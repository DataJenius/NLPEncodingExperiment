Sure, the hairstyle not being long and with the lore will bother people and pull them out of their immersion. So did Frodo being younger and him not waiting around years in the Shire after Gandalf told him about the Ring. They ultimately do not change the story being told. The elf being puerto rican and the dwarf being black and beardless (though I do wish they had given her a beard) also ultimately do not change the story or the world. 

Characters aren't going to treat them differently because of it, since friction between people in Tolkien's world was base entirely upon whether or not you were human, elf, man, dwarf, or hobbit. Not the color of their skin. 

As for the Bullet time, if we're going based off of the movies there is a plethora of scenes that back up the fact that Elves can do feats other races cannot (Legolas killing the Oliphant being the biggest one). If we're going off of Tolkien's writings in the the first book Legolas was light enough to walk on top of snow, and in the series he could see farther than anyone. In the Nature of Middle Earth Tolkien wrote:   


""Thus the Quendi did not and do not ""live slowly"", moving ponderously like tortoises, while Time flickers past them and their sluggish thoughts! Indeed, they move and think swifter than Men, and achieve more than a Man in any given length of time. \* But they have a far greater native vitality and energy to draw upon, so that it takes and will take a very great length of time to expend it.  
\* But not on a wholly different time-scale. Thus to a Man Elves appear to speak rapidly but clearly (unless they retard their speech for Men's sake), to move quickly and featly (**unless they are in urgency, or much moved, when the movement of their hands, for example, may become too swift for human eyes to follow closely**), and only their thought, perception, and reasoning seem normally beyond human speed. ""

\-Page 23, the Nature of Middle Earth Emphasis mine.   


That outright says that they are not only capable of percieving things faster than Men can, but they are outright faster to the point that Men can't even follow it. More than fast enough, imo, to see and catch an arrow out of the air.   


Also, saying that 'reflect the world' opens the door to them putting in cellphones or guns or tik-tok or whatever other thing this argument constantly inserts is a strawman. The color of character's skin or the style of a character's hair doesn't affect the world or the story. Not in Tolkien's world. It might break immersion and not line up perfectly, but it doesn't affect the story. It might look silly and out of place, but it doesn't change anything. Those things would directly change the story and the world on a direct and significantly impactful scale. Gandalf, afterall, would have just been able to ride the eagles with his AK-47 and shoot down the Nazgul. He could have called Frodo and let him know what was going on, he could have called and let the Fellowship know what was happening. Directly changing the story.  


If Gandalf had been clean shaven and black, the story wouldn't have changed. He just wouldn't have been an accurate adaptation of his description in the book.","changing hairstyles and changing age are the exact same type of change though it is by and large inconsequential sure the hairstyle not being long and with the lore will bother people and pull them out of their immersion so did frodo being younger and him not waiting around years in the shire after gandalf told him about the ring they ultimately do not change the story being told the elf being puerto rican and the dwarf being black and beardless though i do wish they had given her a beard also ultimately do not change the story or the world

Regardless, neither in fantasy nor in real life are homogeneity indicative of identical coloring in a species/race. Homogeneity is relevant in terms of physiology.

37426,151,1,"train",1,"/r/lotr","Not that they exist, what I think people are complaining about is that the show-runners want to try to represent that there are significant populations of black elves and dwarves in Tolkiens story. Black people do exist in Tolkiens world, they are humans, and they live in the south region of the land known as Harad. 

It isn't so much ""politics"" as it is a ""social movement"" to change places and times in history where there wasn't any significant numbers of black people, as if having significant populations of black people was completely normal in those times and places. Basically, an attempt to rewrite history to make it more socially acceptable by modern day people. 

The show-runners even admit this when they say they decided to make Tolkiens world look like ""what the real world actually looks like"". Or in other words, they were not going to make Tolkiens world look like how he portrayed it in his own story. 

In the modern world, just about every country has a significant population of black people, except for countries where the population is dominated by a single racial group, like Japan is still 95% Japanese I believe, same goes for Italy being 95% Italian, and a few other countries. Not to mention many African countries which are 95% black, or China which is more than 95% asian. Homogeneous nations exist all over the world, even today, not every country is a melting pot. 

Tolkiens world, to the best of our knowledge, the lands where the stories of the Hobbit and LOTR take place, the population was 95% white, just like England was 8000 years ago, which was the English setting that he based his story on, except that the population was made up of Humans, Elves, Dwarves, and Hobbits. The other 5%, the black population, were humans, and came from the south.

If you watched the OP video, you'll see that PJ says that what Tolkien wanted to do was to create a ""mythology for England"". An England that ""might have existed 8000 years ago"". If that was the authors intention, then anyone who adapts his story should respect that and keep their ""social causes"" out of the picture. That is what PJ tried to do, and even though he made changes, his films are considered by many to be masterpieces. These show-runners aren't respecting that, and that's why the fans are upset.

They hit people from different sides. I am still not satisfied with at least half the things that have been changed and accepted the rest of the half with mostly reluctance. 

Let's agree that bullet timing Puerto Rican Elf is not the same with putting a Lurtz vs. Boromir scene. Giving every elf a GQ model hairstyle is not the same with changing Frodo's age. They are mostly similar to scenes of having elves teleporting to Helm's Deep, using Elrond as a courier to deliver Narsil, having Legolas shieldsurf in Helm's Deep. Not to mention the parts from books that are removed from movies or action/battle scenes that have been added.

Also, probably our expectations were lower. 

I guess Two Towers was my least favorite amongst LotR (lorewise). If you look at it as fantasy-action movie however it is quite nice.

Why not have people cellphones, we have those as well haven't we? Instead of Sauron let's use Stalin or maybe some colonists. Maybe Annatar should just give up crafting rings and post TikTok for elven bullying.

It makes the lines of where once society begins and another kingdoms ends difficult. It also feels also feels a little like tokenism. I think that would hurt the world building.

That’s the end of this thread for me.","yes thats a little harsh and not a good comparison and im not denying anything to people with black skin just to round out my point again if the show goes the direction of the witcher and makes all societies in middle earth look like nyc i think that would be a poor choice  it makes the lines of where once society begins and another kingdoms ends difficult it also feels also feels a little like tokenism i think that would hurt the world building i prefer the show goes the way of having characters who are black and brown be of the background or are from haradeasternlings to me that would enrich the story by both including the representation people want and introducing areas we havent seen in screen of course we dont know what the show is doing we have to wait and see my original point in getting involved in this thread is that many of us fans who are skeptical of this shows decisions are not simply anti black people in the lotr but have legitimate concerns on what the show may be doing and we would like to be heard without being shut down as racist ultimately these are artistic decisions which the show has the final say on and anyone has the right for whatever they choose to do thats the end of this thread for me"

They have a website that lists every single difference between the movies and the books, and they list hundreds of them with credibility scores, months before the movie's release. They also had leaks from the set and maybe even part of the script. Yet they were still wrong about the movie being a total disaster and a disgrace and a lot of things they worried about turned out to be rumors or the result of their own paranoia. What makes you think you're smarter than they were or that your pessimism is more justified and grounded than theirs when you admit that we do know way less than they did.
2. The new show is set in Second Age, not Third Age. This is like the most basic and fundamental thing about this show, which makes me wonder what exactly do you base your skepticism on? If you haven't read the latest interview of the show runners, they explained the 4-5 stories they want to do in the Second Age. They will need to fill in some blanks, since most Tolkien stories outside of LoTR and Hobbit are much more sparse in terms of actual materials, but it doesn't mean it will definitely be trash.
3. Like I said, you're bringing a lot of the frustration and outrage on yourself, and it's not healthy. I choose to be happier. You can too.

Like I said in the post, some of these critiques are fine, but the point is, all these things they were criticizing ended up not being that big a deal one way or another for the movie as a whole. They didn't reduce the movie into a disaster or anything close to that. Their worries might have been valid, but they were wildly out of proportion and out of context. Also, if they had said the same critiques after they actually watched the movie, then it's a matter of different taste or preference and it's fine, but they said them before the watched it, and ended up creating much unnecessary frustration and paranoia for themselves and others.

Also, Lurtz was cited at least 30-50 times in that thread as evidence why the movie will suck. But they were too repetitive so I didn't include more.

The fight choreography is frankly some of the worst I've recently seen. Some moments were cool but for the most part it felt like a b-grade movie action scene. 

Boba/Mando flying down on jetpacks while shooting and some of the rancor stuff was cool but the overall battle was pretty lazy from a choreography standpoint, particularly the part where everyone joined up.

All of them hid behind that one racer car thing for like a good chunk of the fight. *All of them*. One rocket to that area would have taken all of them out. I understand you usually have to suspense disbelief when it comes to tactics shown on screen, but usually if it looks cool (like Mando/Boba fighting in the damn open for some reason, at least it looked cool seeing shit bouncing off their armors and seeing them use their tech) I think it would be more acceptable.

The final scene with the assassination of the bosses wasn't great either. It's the lazy-have them all standing still and see the laser shoot them down but somehow they couldn't see where it's coming from.

Boba Fett, who up until this point was the universes' most badass bounty hunter got tamed down so they can give that kind of image to Mando (so much so they gave him 2 whole episodes in a series that is not his.)

That first trailer for the Fellowship of the Ring was perfect when it came out. It kept enough of the wonder and mysticism of story and the world whilst showing glimpses of characters and events that would keep you intrigued as to what was happening and why. It helped establish who was who in the zoo. This had none of that. It's just flashy CGI interspersed with more flashy CGI with fragmented shots of characters with nothing to back up who they are or what they are doing. 

Also, this just doesn't *feel* like Middle Earth. I understand that it is set in the Second Age, but the design that Amazon have gone with feels more akin to Warcraft than the Lord of the Rings. It looks like cookie cutter fantasy with big buildings and wide scenic shots to establish that yes, this is a fantasy world. If the trailer dropped and didn't say that it was for a Lord of the Rings prequel, I would not have guessed it was related to Middle Earth at all. 

On top of that, it all looks too clean and sanitised. The heavy use of CGI is reminiscent of the Hobbit films. But at least even then they had the right elements to give them their own aesthetic and feel. Not having Weta Workshop involved in the practical effects and costuming/weapons/armour of this project is going to be a massive disservice to the series, I believe. The world that Weta helped create felt real and lived-in. Everything was weathered, everything looked like it had its own individual story. The costumes felt like characters themselves, the sets looked like they had centuries of history behind them. This just seems like expensive sets sat on expensive cosplay. 

Of course, we have only a minute of quick-cut footage and some images from Vanity Fair to go off of. But I personally don't have a lot of hope or faith in this being a solid addition to the Middle Earth mythos, or something that Tolkien and his son would be proud of.

28970,244,1,"train",1,"/r/lotr","Yeah, that's what most folks screamed about so loudly and less eloquently that entire time, including me at some points. The problem with the marketing is, that like you said, it shows all the things fans of other franchises experienced time and time again. Diversity in real life and representation of such in new movies and shows in our time period is important and even beloved when done right, but changing characters around and shoving this good message into things were it doesn't belong, only achieves the opposite. 


I would give as much of a fuck I give about elves at Helms Deep in regards to black elves, if everything else they would have shown me is great. I still wouldn't like it, since it breaks the lore, but I'd accept this choice, since it would have been made to enhance a product, like the elves at helms deep made the scene cooler. The problem is, that trailers, teasers, photoshoots, interviews and panels are all designed to give people a chance to build their opinion and up until now every single one of these are horrendous. Take the ""Superfan"" panel for example. They literally laughed their asses off on ideas that Tolkien had and wrote about and said things along the lines of ""imagine [thing that Tolkien explicitly wrote about], that would be so stupid and problematic"". Those aren't Superfans, those are 4 idiots posing as Tolkien fans who probably haven't even read any of the books or even seen the extended editions of any of the movies. If they use that for marketing, then they sure as hell dont give a fuck about the fanbase and calling us racist, sexist and fascist, doesn't help with that either. I dont get why a series set in a different world, a fantasy world at that, would need to have our diversity demographic (and with ""our"" I kinda only mean the american, because those diversity standards really dont depict the reality anywhere else in the world besides america, as a german I often find that rather weird, to see my country depicted in ways that make it seem like a reskin of america) and address our social problems. It doesn't make sense, even though they said it - saying something doesn't make it true.


I would have loved to see them do a series based on something Tolkien actually wrote about and I would have been fine with them including diversity, as long as those diverse people are only human, if they would have done that and just stuck to the lore they do have the rights to, they could have done something awesome. They could have included any social commentary, with just using the things Tolkien wrote about and it would be noticable enough to make the people happy that care for those kinds of things. What they are doing is, taking a beloved franchise and restructuring it into something that can spew their propaganda and push their agenda, even though in actuality the people in charge dont care for that and dont belive in it, they only do it, to get richer. 


They did it to Wheel of Time, Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Star Trek and even games like dungeons and dragons get needlessly woke in some very strange ways to sell more stuff. This is a problem. Fans of those franchises kept them alive for all those years and now they want to alianate these fans, only because they want to use what we kept alive and thriving, to make money. And they dont care about the fans at all. Is it wrong that they want to make money? No, every sane buisinessman and businesswoman should focus on making money, but the second most important thing should be, that the fans are happy. What they do is basicly creating new, toxic fandoms for those franchises that they can sell anything to and while being a brilliant idea in terms of moneymaking, it destroys everything the original source was about and it destroys the previous fandom.


So yeah, without going into much detail, I can only say, I agree with you and I am glad that you could express what I wasn't able to express in such a good way, due to my emotional attachment to the source that they basicly raped, even though I tried - but in my defense, being called racist and sexist everytime I said something probably didn't help to keep it civil.","yeah thats what most folks screamed about so loudly and less eloquently that entire time including me at some points the problem with the marketing is that like you said it shows all the things fans of other franchises experienced time and time again diversity in real life and representation of such in new movies and shows in our time period is important and even beloved when done right but changing characters around and shoving this good message into things were it doesnt belong only achieves the opposite

The visual allusion is far too on the nose to be a coincidence.

We see Kylo in the beginning, filled with conflict, unsure of himself. Snoke takes advantage and keeps him down.

Then, near the end, Kylo is determined and kills Snoke with ease despite Snoke's supposed ""power."" This is because he's drawing on how much he cares about Rey as his source of power. In that moment, he's not trying to live up to Vader anymore.

The audience is meant to draw comparisons between these two scenes: they basically book end the film and take place in the same location using a similar setup - Kylo kneeling before Snoke.

Snoke basically spells this out:

*Where there was conflict, I now sense resolve. Where there was weakness, strength.*

I'm just so confused about this show.

1) They go how many episodes with Boba then randomly just cut to a Mando-centric two episodes. Felt so random.

2) They kind of kill the effect of the whole Mando Season 2 finale by having Grogu already reunite with him. I didn't mind him seeing him from afar last episode and you knew Grogu was going to have a choice but it feels so strange to make it not even in Mando's show. Because now they start Season 3 back together? What if you only watch Mando and not BoBF? So jarring and such an odd decision.

3) You bring in Cad Bane just to have him killed? If you haven't watched The Clone Wars you're like okay who's this blue guy? Oh well, he's dead. Again, strange. I'm fine with the death but they should have established him earlier or something. Seemed like a waste of his character appearing. Could have easily been some no-name. I was kind of expecting Maul or someone else syndicate-related to pop up but that's fine that he didn't.

4) I just still don't get why this show exists. Are they doing multiple seasons? I felt Boba worked perfectly in Mando as a side-arc character. I agree with someone else who had posted that this should have been called The Mandalorian: Book of Boba Fett. Then at least the jumping to Mando stuff could have seemed more natural.

I don't think this allusion works, honestly. The Wizard of Oz projected a big hologram of himself, while he hid his true self, to make him seem more powerful than he actually was. Snoke is not hiding anything. The only reason he's communicating through hologram is that he can't be there in person.

44620,193,1,"train",1,"/r/lotr","This is awesome. Thanks for sharing it. Very useful to the discussion, no matter your position.

There is nothing wrong with finding a justification in the text for inclusion, if that is what you need to convince you (or you think it would help convince others). I have to ask, though. What if you couldn't find a case for it? What if we find a long lost letter from Tolkien outright rejecting the idea of black elves as preposterous?

My case isn't built on what Tolkien would have wanted, since we do not know with certainty. We know he hated apartheid. We know he thought the nazis fools for building their ideology on top of a mythic, racially pure ""[Aryan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordicism)"" identity. The work above is highly suggestive that his feelings on the matter were not that strong. But forget all that. Let's say, in his heart-of-hearts, he did not want black elves. So what?

Imagine a world where women have long beards as an immutable characteristic, were systemically enslaved, tortured, raped, slaughtered without consequence, and only recently received a form of legal (not actual economic or social) parity with their beardless brothers and sisters, and all of this horribleness “dictated” by the presence of absence of that beard. I don’t care if stories that didn’t originally feature them, produced by the dominant beardless peoples, originally had the bearded women or not. Put the bearded women in and let's stop acting like children.

We are lucky that Tolkien's story isn't contingent on the skin color of any one character. It's simply not important.

Are we really going to line up a group of actors, bust out the calipers and skin shade guide, and start measuring their ""European"" features? At one point does a children's production of a LotR story permit black and brown children to play the roles of central figures like Gandalf, but the idea then later becomes absurd when they grow up? Sorry, Timmy, you are too old and too black to play Gandalf.

Middle Earth is not history. It's not Europe. It's inhabitants aren't the ancestors of Europeans. Its locations do not map in any meaningful sense to European geography. Rhun is not fantasy Asia and Harad is not fantasy Africa (as if this lazy 1-to-1 mapping is clever world-building). The events depicted aren't discoverable through academic research, anthropology and archeology. To the extent it is European influenced is because Tolkien himself was European, and he was passionate about European myths and languages. He wrote what he knew and cared about. That's all there is to it.

Maybe, just maybe, let's leave all this nonsense behind. No one is going to rewrite the text I wouldn't want that. These are adaptations intended for modern audiences, and no matter the racial make-up of the cast, they likely would have been hated by both JRR and Christopher Tolkien for entirely different reasons.","this is awesome thanks for sharing it very useful to the discussion no matter your position

To use another franchise as an example, in Avengers 1 Tony tells Banner that Hulk saved him from gamma poisoning for a reason.

However, the Russo's come along, and Hulk makes a comment in Endgame that ""he was made for this"". While not directly referencing the concersation in Avengers 1, it stands to reason that the Russo's did indeed see that scene and connected it to their plot, and many fans made the same connection. 

Whether you think they did a good job with this in the sequel trilogy, it's fair to say that what wasn't originally a plan in TFA can still be a hint after TROS comes out, assuming that Abrams did look back at those movies and think ""you know, we've had Kylo talking to Vader's helmet, but what if it was Palpatine?""","id argue that a good filmmaker should finds unplanned plot threads in old movies and use them to connect to their new film just because it wasnt the original plan doesnt mean the latest one cant tie itself to previous plot points

19744,192,1,"train",0,"/r/StarWars","The idea I had was that Plagueis had learnt how to keep his spirit alive after his body died. Upon his 'death' at the hands of Palpatine, Plagueis' body and spirit were separated. Some time later, maybe post ROTJ maybe earlier, Plagueis' body and spirit bond together again, resulting in some disfigurement. 

Plagueis travels the galaxy, sensing what's happened through objects and places connected to the Clone Wars and the Galactic Civil War. With this knowledge, Plagueis seeks to build his own army, and starts scouting for Imperal remnants.

On this journey, his senses the dark side in another life form, Ben Solo and begins his communication with him, grooming him to join the dark side. This leads to Ben's conflict with Luke, and him eventually joining the Knights of Ren, who I think would be revealed to be Plagueis' elite task force.

While training Ben, Plagueis, going by Snoke at this point, senses dark side potential, young but familiar. He's sure of it; this person is the descendent of his apprentice, Sidious. The Knights of Ren spy on the young Rey, monitoring her, maybe even protecting her for an ulterior motive.

Fast forward to the TLJ throne scene, after an intense fight with the Royal guards and the supposed death of Snoke, the real Snoke appears from the shadows as his force projection dissappears. He explains who he is, what his apprentice did to him, and who Rey is. He offers her what she's always wanted; family. Under his guidance, she will not only follow in her grandfather's footsteps, but surpass him. Rey accepts his offer. Holding the lightsaber of Kylo Ren, Rey Palpatine leaves with her new master, leaving Ben to die

Over the next couple of years, Rey becomes a master of the dark side, learning how to utilise force lighting, and manipulate the force in much greater ways. With the crystal from Kylo's lightsaber, as well as a second one she earned herself, she forges a new lightsaber; one that can be used as both a single and double bladed lightsaber.

As the rule of two dictates, Rey kills Snoke, this time taking extra care to keep him from coming back. With Snoke's death, Rey assumes leadership of the Sith Armada.

There's a lot that goes into both making and criticizing things.

I must also add, I don't really have a bone against him in that I understand the frustration of having to work on something commercial with a budget.

In any case I agree that Rodriguez is a terrible fit for Star Wars (obviously the writing had some serious issues as well). 

Also after watching the Mandalorian episodes of this show I realized that Din’s helmet is actually a much more powerful device in enhancing the depth of his character than I remembered. 

I think they had a lot of potential with the Tusken Raider story line as to shaping who Boba Fett is becoming, but I feel the writers and directors failed to actually tell us who Boba Fett is at his core. The flashbacks of his personal life mostly told us things we already knew or could have assumed. 

We also didn’t learn anything about Fennec either. Her character was basically relegated to a narrator and almost all her decisions were ignored even though she is Boba’s primary consul. At the same time Boba goes around taking suggestions from the random youths in the seriously out-of-place mod gang (my least favorite part of the show).

Also absolutely no disrespect to Temuera Morrison or Ming-Na Wen- I think they did as best as actors could with the terrible writing and directing they encountered for much of the show.

Until next time, may the force be with us all!","i like that there is a pattern in these threads

Racism is never over. But it's not a white people's thing, it's human inherent nature. White people are racist. Black people are racist. Humans are tribal creatures in general. But you have a choice to be a bitter loser who plays victim and puts his blame on others, or step up and be the best person you can be and work hard to make something out of yourself. World is unfair, no one awes you anything, it's on you to succeed and overcome your odds, when the cards you are given are against you.   


>Tolkien is dead mate. Hate to break it to you. Any adaptation of his work is going to reflect the political moment and imagination of the creators. It’s not a matter of “injecting” anything. Your side is simply losing. The world is becoming more inclusive.

I am 100% pro inclusivity, when it is based on merit and talent. When someone is hired based on diversity quota, it devalues their achievement and takes away the chance of those who deserved it more. I hate to break it to you but ""my side"" is not losing, there is no ""my side"". All this woke content flops or underperforms and in the end everyone is losing because all of us are getting shitty content. 

Moreover, I never said I am against black people in lotr or any franchise for that matter. I just want them to be casted into fitting roles with backgrounds that make sense from within the lore. GoT did an amazing job at that, this creative team could do better given that they want to make spiritual successor to GoT.

>Read about the history of “white” and educate yourself.

Lets recap. Black people sold other people to white people. White people heavily mistreated and discriminated black people on state level all the way till 60s. 

The impact black people experienced made them very, bitter, racist and pessimistic. This harbored hate like religion got passed from generation to generation till this day. Some black people choose to let go of hate, to better themselves, do the best they can to succeed in life given their unfortunate situation. Others gave up, blame society, indulge in their hate for white people and the system.

14500,262,1,"train",0,"/r/StarWars","I love how the Vespa mods get spared and the Gamorreans don't. They'd make sense on Coruscant, on Tatooine its a total eyesore. 

I think the episode suffers from too many ideas thrown into the pot. The script really feels like  Star Wars RPG campaign being narrated, with author PC avatars thrown in. I felt no agency or suspense at all this episode for the characters. Two Mods, two Gamorreans are the losses? Somehow Fett & Friends somehow take out the Three Families and the Cartel in one go, so much for that buildup. The show's trying to be badass, but it hits as hard as a G-rated film on Disney's afternoon block. The Star Wars aesthetic can only carry something so much. Those Freetown Extras and Mod actors are fucking terrible at portraying a firefight, and those Mods are explicitly shooters in a space western. 

All this could have been solved by Slave 1; it's BOBA who has to stay on the ground -> nothing stops Shand from driving that thing high up in orbit waiting to respond, or better yet, idling at the Palace's hangars. Equally plausible would've been R2-D2 homing in on the Mando, pulling a Reverse Uno bounty-tag, overflying the fight, and strafing & torping the heavy droids out.

The only conflict I could see threatening Fett would be if Shand decides she's tired of being ignored and takes charge herself and actually plays the Daimyo role. This whole series has been lampshading about how they've all gone soft.

I absolutely did love Cad being an anti-villain in this. He essentially gave the fight to Fett, goading him, forcing Fett to get to the next level of badass. That reveal of the Tusken massacre absolutely did rile Fett up, but it also motivated Boba. Quite poetic how in the end, Cad was still the better gunslinger, but in the typical victorious villain fashion of gloating, placed himself into melee range against a capability he never knew Boba developed (Sand-Fu).

What happens next? The quisling Twi'lek would be the natural candidate to assume the Mayor's spot, especially as Fett has him under thumb. Freetown goes into formal partnership with Mos Espa. Fett has a hook now to go after what remains of the cartel on Tatooine for his Tusken tribe. Maybe some stupid Republic incursion to take full possession of Tatooine that Fett will have some inane conundrum over his claim versus what he believes is best for the people. I could see Fett seeking out the Tusken tribes to cooperate and coexist, not to change their ways, but act as an intermediary between modern Tatooine society and those whose ways see them as the hereditary rulers of the planet. To paraphrase from an earlier franchise: **God created Tatooine to train the Faithful.**

Ultimately, Grogu choosing Mando as his FAMILY is the best takeaway from this episode; even though their reunion midfirefight really felt forced (I loved his power progression, and how Grogu is not succumbing to the Dark Side in applying his powers). Go float rocks Luke, all you are doing is perpetuating a cycle of Jedi failure. Ahsoka was right there as living testament of where the order fucks up in developing younglings and being loyal to them, but nope, you are still going to solo this instead of utilizing her as the prototypical reformer; someone who has living memory of going through Youngling-Padawan, before the faults in the system prevented her from achieving knighthood. 

P.S. Anyone else see how Fennec Shand is finally a Star Wars character that matches the Imperial Agent-class of PC in The Old Republic MMO? She's got the stealth, sniping, and the knifework.","i love how the vespa mods get spared and the gamorreans dont theyd make sense on coruscant on tatooine its a total eyesore

Still, perhaps that's why I have had no trouble enjoying the *Wheel of Time* series. Even though it wasn't a masterpiece like the LotR movies, I felt no sense of outrage, and enjoyed it the most when it wasn't even trying to reproduce scenes from the books.

i wasnt one of the complainers in fact i went to see the movies several times but the more they diverged from the books the more uncomfortable i became the extended editions helped but it really wasnt until i saw the movies again through the eyes of my daughter decades later that i came to terms with the changes

still perhaps thats why i have had no trouble enjoying the wheel of time series even though it wasnt a masterpiece like the lotr movies i felt no sense of outrage and enjoyed it the most when it wasnt even trying to reproduce scenes from the books

39818,94,1,"train",1,"/r/lotr","I really enjoyed it!! I wasn’t expecting to get so attached to the characters, especially the hobbits. It’s was such an immersive trilogy and I think one of the best book to movie adaptations. Two decades later and the sfx still holds up, and the fact that they filmed it all in one fell swoop made it even cooler! I HATE when sequels ignore character changes like hair or aging (Anabeth in the Percy Jackson movies is a perfect example). I watched the extended versions of each on HBO Max and they didn’t even feel as long as they were. My one tiny let down is how they didn’t seem to emphasize enough how tricky the ring was to keep track of/carry and how it can change shape or weight to get to where it wants to go, unless I somehow missed it. They had Frodo mention it felt heavy as they were climbing but without the context from the book (and later hobbit movie) I didn’t really get why he said that. But overall one of the most enjoyable franchises I’ve ever seen. 

The hobbit movies fell a little flat just because the costumes looked too new and the dwarves were not at all how they were described in the book so it was hard for me to remember who was who apart from Thorin, Bombur, Fili and Kili!

The episode was full of weird editing - like when boba leaves the shelter to cad bane to negotiate and puts on his helmet, it was dead awkward. At the 30 minute mark, Mando runs from the droid in and the same shot is used twenty seconds prior.

Then there was unnecessary/strange dialogue, like when fennec saves the mods, the main girl stops her for a long second and goes ""thanks"" -  that threw the pace for me. I've always been on the fence with Meli Potto, but BoBF hasn't done her (or anyone) favours, but when she said to Mando ""I can't hear you"" while explosions go on in the background it implied her character was daft.

The Rancor was cool so there's that. 

Cad Bane was also cool, but felt like him dying really sucked and that he was used as a scapegoat because the writers didn't want to develop any characters, except for Boba Fett who's good now?

9609,97,1,"train",0,"/r/StarWars","Few things I didn’t like from the episode:

1) Did anyone else think it took them an embarrassingly long time to realize the droids were ray-shielded? In other movies/series they figured it it out much sooner.

2) I thought riding a rancor would take “much discipline and training”, but it seems here that a few days in the dungeon is all it needs. The rancor is even able to obey his commands! Hell he doesn’t even have to, he literally lifts a pike up to Boba so he can kill it. At least he rode it… LIKE A BANTHA :D

3) The Cad Bane vs Boba fight should’ve been more climactic. Their history goes back so far that their 2 minute scuffle just wasn’t all that fulfilling imo. Also, why would Bane wait till the pikes have clearly lost the battle to join?

4) So you’re telling me that Grogu’s back simply to be Din’s force-sensitive plot armor? Also I’m sure there were several situations where Din could’ve totally gotten himself out of, but instead chose to make like an old man and say “help, I’ve fallen and i can’t get up!” When he was pinned down against the droid and rancor, couldn’t he have used his jet pack to dodge the attack? What was his plan if Grogu was distracted by a womp rat, accept his fate? 

5) I was half expecting something related to Mando season 3 or a future series for the end credits scene, but just Vanth? The writing was mid to the end.

6) ITS THE SEASON FINALE. Why was it written so mediocrely? I’m honestly disappointed.","few things i didnt like from the episode

Elves, men, hobbits and dwarves all have the same hairstyles too. There is obviously some sort of law that prohibits a hobbit from using straighteners, from men cutting their hair shorter or having it as long and straight as an elf, and a mohawk for a dwarf is completely out of the question (oh wait, they did that already). But elves having shorter hairstyles being heavily criticised.... 

Like maybe the producers thought, like I do, that it's dumb and unoriginal to have all races look identical. It's theoretically and fictionally racist. Like telling a black woman she can't have straight hair because it grows as an afro. I know that's an extreme example but it's what I'm thinking about when people talk about it. Also, Elronds haircut here was very popular back in Tolkeins day. Early 1900's was rife with those swept locks and it looked swish af.  I hardly think it takes clippers to xreate all these hairstyles, as for the black elf, its likely that he had once or recently shaved his head entirely to have such short hair. Why is that out of the realm of possibility but magic and balrogs aren't...

28975,114,1,"train",1,"/r/lotr",">What is Isaac Asimov's Foundation? I never heard of it. Is it interesting? What's it about?

Asimov has a whole SciFi universe with various stories and novels throughout the timeline, anywhere from the first invention of rudimentary robots on Earth to the rise and fall of a huge galactic empire.  The movie ""Bicentennial Man"" was based on one of his short stories about robots. ""I, Robot"" movie says it was, but it really wasn't all that much.  

The Foundation novels introduce Hary Seldon who invented psychohistory (a field that allow to predict general behavior of people as a group, foreseeing and theoretically guiding historic events and trends). He predicts that the current multi-thousand-planet empire will fall and all of humanity will descend into chaos. While it is too late to stop the fall, he works to establish a Foundation which will shorten the ""dark ages"" and allow a new empire to restore civilization. There are prequels about the last days of the empire and books about the newly established foundation trying to survive after the fall of the original empire. If you like science fiction, I definitely recommend checking it out.

I won't spoil any of the story, but I'll just give you one example. The first mayor in the books (Salvor Hardin) famously refused to even touch guns and hated violence. He made his mark as a clever politician his most favorite quote was ""violence is the last refuge of the incompetent"". So you **know** that his gender-swapped character in the TV show has gunned down half a dozen soldiers in just one military skirmish with a big old sniper rifle.","what is isaac asimovs foundation i never heard of it is it interesting whats it about

Closesly related to that question is whether Sauron will appear or be referenced into it: out of all of Tolkien's stories, Helm's is the one in which Sauron is curiously absent: all the Easterling and Haradrim invasions of Gondor are treated as being prodded into action by Sauron.

But, being that there is a Haradrim invasion on Gondor AND ROHAN (which you can see in the concept art) could that be treated as Sauron's doing?

* Boba has no agency in his own show, everything he does is something someone else told him to do, or someone else doing it for him
* You could edit out every cad bane scene and it doesn't change the story at all. That character has no narrative point. Bad writing.
* so the wookie, right? gets shot like 30 times, has a broken foot halfway twisted off. So he just sits down for like 5 minutes and then he's just fine? Furthermore, why did all those trandoshans pull out knives? I mean literally why? They swarm and pin the wookie, with knives, and nobody stabs him? Going out like ceasar would have been a badass end for the wookie. But again, since nobody is ever in danger and there's no dramatic tension, the swarm of angry mob with knives that successfully tackles and swamps the character just . . . doesn't . . . actually do anything.
* ""the people of mos espa need me"". Then for the love of god show them. Not one single person from mos espa showed up. The mod gang doesn't count, they are being paid. The only civilians that show up are the hicks from out of town. If you try to write a character as a noble defender of the people you need to show your audience that the people need defending. The show does not do that. Actually the show does the opposite of that, with the Pykes repeatedly saying ""just leave us alone and we will leave you alone"", to which Boba takes it upon himself to have a literal war in the middle of town. And then declares himself a defender of the people. That is a villain move. What is this show doing?
* So the giant blaster droid can blow up an armed and armored combat vehicle (the speeder) but it can't blow up a mud wall. Got it. It's strong enough to be thrown through a building, but it's not going to just walk up and smash the little wall. This is bad because it takes what is supposed to be the biggest threat, and makes it not a threat.
* So the rancor is gonna eat one guy whole but the next guy he's just going to take a lil' dainty bite of his head. This doesn't make narrative sense.
* why did we do the checkov's beskar chain mail thing? Why did we do a whole montage of building mando's new jet? Neither of these things are important or used in any way. We are shown and told they are important, but then they aren't even used.
* if you want to build dramatic tension you have to show that danger is dangerous. Nobody important is ever in danger. The pykes either have terrible accuracy or absolutely incredible accuracy with their ability to only hit very specifically armored parts of mando/boba. We see the pykes pin down the mod gang but then Fennec just casually kills them. So the bad guys are dangerous, then they aren't, then they are, then they aren't. The whole fight sequence is very inconsistent with this.
* why did we have this whole big war when Fennec can just assassinate the leadership that easily? This really jars with Boba's self-appointed protector of the people message. He could have just gotten rid of the pykes quietly but instead decides to put the entire town in danger with a massive shootout that destroys a bunch of the city. But then says he's doing it for the people. If I believed the writers knew what they were doing I would say that's sociopathic, narcissistic behavior. Unfortunately it's just another example of Boba, the main character, being a passive part of the scenery in his own show. So is Boba Fett a badass? We see him in shootouts, we see him stand up to Bane, we see him ride a rancor. Badass, right? We also see him fail to come up with a plan, we see him constantly change his mind. We see him make stupid choices (why use cover or rooftops when we could just stand in the middle of the open and get shot a bunch?). We see other characters doing his work for him (Boba didn't take out the pykes, Fennec did). So which is it, show? What are you telling me, writers? Nobody can make up their mind.
* so cad bane is faster than boba. We hear Bane say that he is faster. We see that he is faster when he out draws Boba. Then he is not faster. Apparently Boba can pull a stick off his back and smack someone with it while laying on his back faster than he can point a gun that is already in his hands. If you did this in a movie making 101 class the teacher would rip into you for it, which would be good because it breaks internal consistency and it removes any dramatic tension. It also robs the death of a supposed big bad guy of any weight, because Boba doesn't have to do anything special to win. A good villain should force the main character to have to do something risky or unusual, should force some sort of growth from the main character. Instead all we get is that Cad Bane is fast, he's faster than the marshall, he's faster than Boba. Then he isn't faster than Boba.
* good thing we had that big emotional ending to mando season 2 oh wait I guess in an episode of a spinoff show we're going to undo that whole thing. Again, it's the cad bane problem. If you cut every Luke/jedi scene out of the show, the plot doesn't change at all.
* ok so we're going to give mando and boba this really badass scene where they are fighting together and it's going to look awesome and oh also it's going to change nothing and accomplish nothing because remember, Boba can't actually do anything useful in his own show.

>Did Tolkien say that interracial breeding was disallowed in any of Middle Earth?

I don't really care about the casting and are just reading arguments on both sides, but in Tolkiens work, it's very clearly stated it's just been theee unions between men and elves, Luthien and Beren, Tuor and Idril and Arwen and Aragorn. It seems the elves very seldom mingled with humans. So unless which you want to bring in forced impregnation, which honestly would be very off-coloured to add, elves would be very homogeneous. You could say ""well, one of the men were black"", but all 3 are related, so then you'd have to kinda cast half the liniage of men as black, which would be off-line again with Tolkiens mediaval Europe-centric story.

I think in the lore they are even homogeneous in term of communities in themselves. Noldor, Sindar, etc. mostly stick together it seemed. Even though it was not unusual to have unions between themselves.

What makes the 3 unions of men and elves so significant is the fact it seldom happens, and related to them are often a big story. 

But yeah, not trying to add much to the discussion, just pointing out that ""well, some random Haradrim could have a child with a random Elf"" is such a throwaway line and very off-line in terms of the lore. The 3 unions of men and elves have significance. The amazon series could add it to the black elf character lore and solve it, but then I'd rather have some elf be black than a 4th union of men and elves Amazon has made up. Thats more insulting to the lore.

Anyway, I have my own opinions about all of this, but don't feel like it's necessary to even write. If an elf is black, an elf is black. Not a problem honestly. My hinge is more related to peoples opinion about all this I guess.","you cannot imagine of a world which like england where there were darkskinned moors who were part of the realm and they commingled with the everyone else

His entire point was to make a historical mythology for the English, since the real mythology was wiped out after the norman invasion of 1066. He created a world based upon Germanic language, history, mythology and culture. In Tolkien's mind, these things ""happened"". Therefore the individuals in the story became the eventual inhabitants of britain. And since the inhabitants of britain were white before mass travel and immigration became more common, then skin colour is a factor. 

Take for example the story of Beowulf, if that story is taken as fact and not just legend then its events took place in 6th century Scandinavia. Since there is next to no chance any person of colour was living in these parts around this time, or at the very least incredibly unlikely that it wouldnt be mentioned, then the people involved are white.

The best parts of the show had nothing to do with the titular character, and a lot of what the plot centered around was clunky and seemingly there for fan service. The major battles and action sequences left me scratching my head, as it seemed like the action was a slow burn affair and the result of characters making intentionally poor choices for the sake of the plot. The chases weren’t fast, the shootouts never felt thrilling, a couple of majorly badass characters potential felt completely wasted (fennec, the master assassin who amounts to little more than the hand of the king, and cad bane, who is killed in a 2 minute duel). As a minor pit stop between The Mandalorian seasons, the best parts of the series centered around Din and episodes 5 and 6, which had no Fett in them whatsoever. Even then, when all of the characters assembled for the final battle, Din felt basically useless, and was mostly there so Grogu could show up to literally and metaphorically plot armor his way to a resolution.

I wanted so much more from this series but I can’t help but feel like making a legendary baddie into the town grandpa wasn’t the best choice for the direction of the story.

The rest of the season disappointed me, because it didn't really give Boba his defining moment of growth and just felt underwhelming along with Fennec by his side who doesn't get much of growth or good bonding moments with Boba.

&#x200B;

If I could put all my thoughts on this show into 1 word, it would be confused. TBoBF successfully took what should be a straight forward concept (Boba becoming a crime boss) and turned it into a confused mess where things just kinda happen, an entire separate show appears in the middle, then it just kinda ends with a big action scene.

For the first half of the show the pacing is super weird. All of the flashbacks would have worked much better if they just started the show with Boba escaping the Sarlacc and working their way up from there. Just reorganizing the show with this in mind makes it so much easier to follow in the first 4 episodes, though it doesn't save it from the more strange narrative choices such as the Hutt twins being completely pointless and the modding gang being super out of place on Tatooine.

Boba himself seems to have no real motivation, and what little he has is very inconsistent, then he just says ""damn, I guess being a mob boss ain't for me!"". He also doesn't really do much, which is both a huge waste of the character and Temuera Morrisons' acting skills.

&#x200B;

I did a similar comment when The Bad Batch finished, and I talked about my favorite/ least favorite characters and episodes, but that really doesn't feel fair to do here because the best episodes and characters of course come from episodes 5-6, which are pretty much a completely different show for some strange reason. We could have just had Mando show up in TBoBF and then in season 3 of Mando we get these episodes, instead they awkwardly put them into this show just to get Grogu involved in the climax, which I think was a seriously poor narrative decision despite the fact I honestly loved it in the moment.

Speaking of things I liked in the moment: Luke. Like everyone else, I love me some Luke Skywalker, but wow on rewatch it really shows that he's now completely computer generated down to his voice. His lines are strange (probably because they couldn't get better lines to sound natural), he hardly emotes with his voice, and while the CGI is better, it still feels off. Though I can get over the look. They really just need to stick with a voice actor and not desperately try to cling to Mark Hamill's voice though this weird voice synthesizer.

&#x200B;

I guess my least favorite characters are the modding gang, but that mainly comes down to their aesthetics. You'd think a group revolving around augments on Tatooine would consist of Jawas and rogues, but I guess it's just a bunch of weird human teenagers/young adults? And of course the Power Ranger bikes were amazingly out of place. I guess that makes my least favorite episode #3.

&#x200B;

Episodes 5 and 6 could have been used so much better. We could have seen Boba actually interact with the town outside of the modding gang, see Boba learning to ride his Rancor, introduce Cad Bane earlier and expand on the Pikes and why this town is so important to them.

Final thoughts: This is a show that never really found out what it wanted to be, then it just became a completely different show halfway though before wrapping up. It really feels like some executive just decided ""lets have someone make a Boba Fett show, he's cool right?"" and then just got some people to direct a few episodes right afterwards.","tldr there was no book in the book of boba fett

But Fingolfin sprang aside, and Grond rent a mighty pit in the earth.... Many times Morgoth essayed to smite him, and each time Fingolfin leaped away...; and he wounded Morgoth with seven wounds, and seven times Morgoth gave a cry of anguish, whereat the hosts of Angband fell upon their faces in dismay, and the cries echoed in the Northlands.

But at the last the King grew weary, and Morgoth bore down his shield upon him. Thrice he was crushed to his knees, and thrice arose again and bore up his broken shield and stricken helm. But the earth was all... pitted about him, and he stumbled and fell backward before the feet of Morgoth; and Morgoth set his left foot upon his neck.... Yet with his last and desperate stroke Fingolfin hewed the foot with Ringil, and the blood gushed forth black and smoking and filled the pits of Grond.

Thus died Fingolfin, High King of the Noldor, most proud and valiant of the Elven-kings of old. The Orcs made no boast of that duel at the gate; neither do the Elves sing of it, for their sorrow is too deep. Yet the tale of it is remembered still, for Thorondor King of Eagles brought the tidings to Gondolin, and to Hithlum afar off. And Morgoth took the body of the Elven-king and broke it, and would cast it to his wolves; but Thorondor came hasting from his eyrie among the peaks of the Crissaegrim, and he stooped upon Morgoth and marred his face. The rushing of the wings of Thorondor was like the noise of the winds of Manwë, and he seized the body in his mighty talons, and soaring suddenly above the darts of the Orcs he bore the King away. And he laid him upon a mountain-top that looked from the north upon the hidden valley of Gondolin; and Turgon coming built a high cairn over his father. No Orc dared ever after to pass over the mound of Fingolfin or draw nigh his tomb, until the doom of Gondolin was come and treachery was born among his kin. Morgoth went ever halt of one foot after that day, and the pain of his wounds could not be healed; and in his face was the scar that Thorondor made.

19095,134,1,"train",0,"/r/StarWars","IIRC correctly (I read Iger’s memoir), they ended up over-paying for Lucasfilm. Lucas was asking for something like $8 billion because that’s what they bought Pixar for, which was way out of their budget for an IP that they’d have to rebuild from scratch. They countered with something in the $3 billion range, but Lucas wouldn’t agree. Ultimately, they ended up paying slightly more than they did for Marvel (a studio that already had a thriving business), and only then it was because some change to the CA tax code convinced George it was time to sell.

Iger actually walked through how they came up with the number they did, and they basically looked at how much the PT made in theaters (as well as some of the merchandise sales) and guesstimated how much they could make with movies, merch, and park attractions in a worst case scenario situation, and came to the conclusion that they really couldn’t afford to spend that much.

My conclusion is that those early estimations created the urgency. The reality is that the IP was worthless for them until they did something with it. While it’s easy for fans to think every Star Wars movie would earn billions at the box office, we know for a fact now it’s not always a slam dunk. Imagine if The Force Awakens did Rise of Skywalker—or even *Solo*—numbers. Imagine if the reviews weren’t all that great and “Star Wars fatigue” was already being talked about… VIII and IX would have been complete disasters and the franchise would be dead before it even started.

Iger isn’t a stranger to the business. He probably knew giving Michael Arndt the extra time he needed to polish the early TFA drafts wasn’t really going to make *that* much of a difference for TFA—and he was probably right. 

The fatal flaw IMO was the lack of continuity among the creative team, not the lack of a plan or time to write story treatments for all three films before filming began. For a comparison, George never stuck to his plans, but it really didn’t matter because he knew the broad strokes of where things were headed.","iirc correctly i read igers memoir they ended up overpaying for lucasfilm lucas was asking for something like  billion because thats what they bought pixar for which was way out of their budget for an ip that theyd have to rebuild from scratch they countered with something in the  billion range but lucas wouldnt agree ultimately they ended up paying slightly more than they did for marvel a studio that already had a thriving business and only then it was because some change to the ca tax code convinced george it was time to sell

iger actually walked through how they came up with the number they did and they basically looked at how much the pt made in theaters as well as some of the merchandise sales and guesstimated how much they could make with movies merch and park attractions in a worst case scenario situation and came to the conclusion that they really couldnt afford to spend that much

OP's post is just one example of the wider point; over his lifetime Tolkien was always of different minds and the only fully realised work we have from him are The Hobbit and LOTR.

Christopher Tolkien made it absolutely clear in the foreword, also, that the Silmarillion is not to be taken to be consistent with those books or even within the Silmarillion itself. This is true for everything else collated from notes and unfinished works.

They are fashioned beneath the world of earth and stone. Seven dwarf fathers who found different clans and wake in completely different parts of the world. 

In the 1st age we learn of two clans who live in the Blue Mountains, the Broadbeams and Firebeards, and of the Longbeards who live to the south. The other four never enter into the tales except to say that each in their own part answered Thrain's call in the dwarf and goblin wars. They have names like Stonefoots and Ironfists, Blacklocks and Stiffbeards. What do these names mean? They clearly indicate distinct physical appearances. Long beards. Black hair. Red beards. Broad shoulders. Thick or brittle beards. Could Stonefoots describe a people who are less nomadic (slow or sluggish, as lead-footed)? Could Ironfists describe hard handedness, or powerful grips? *Possibly*, but not likely. In keeping with the obvious physical descriptions of the other clan names, it is apparent that Stonefoots describes their physical makeup, and this clans people are much sturdier than other Dwarves (ie: their skin is much thicker, more like to stone than flesh), and that Ironfists suggest their composition is like to literal iron, metallic as opposed to flesh-like. *What color is iron?*

Dwarf women having beards is a film-only comment. It is not in the main books (again, as noted by the author). You have to deep dive into the History of Middle Earth, the Peoples of Middle Earth to learn more about Dwarves and get a line about women having beards. And as another poster mentions, so what? Take numenorian royalty who have no beards (Aragorn) and give him a beard, and nobody bats an eye. Take a made up dwarf princess and make her beardless, and everybody loses their minds.





*In any case, there is nothing wrong with casting homogeneous races in order to keep to the lore. If you have a problem with that, then you care about race more than you should.*

This is some cognitive dissonance right here. One could just as easily say there is nothing wrong with casting diverse races even if it goes against supposed lore, and if you have a problem with *that* then you care about race more than you should.","theres no detail to suggest that they are homogenous none in fact their origins suggest that they are anything but homogeneous they are fashioned beneath the world of earth and stone seven dwarf fathers who found different clans and wake in completely different parts of the world

Tolkien later retconned this because she's much more saintly in LotR than she was in *The Silmarillion*. But originally she part of the Noldor rebellion and refused amnesty from the Valar when it was offered at the end of the War of Wrath. 

She wasn't evil, but she was very proud, almost on the same level as Feanor himself. And she established Lothlorien as her mock-Valinor in Middle-earth, using one of the Great Elven Rings to do it. 

As beautiful as Lothlorien was, it was a mistake, an act of pride, which was destined to fail. The temptation to take the One Ring and save Lothlorien was real, and saying ""no"" was hard, but she redeemed herself by doing so and aiding the destruction of the Ring, even though it meant losing everything she had built with no guarantee of refuge in Valinor.

This is the meaning behind the song she sings when saying ""farewell"" to the Fellowship:

long years numberless as the wings of trees!  
The long years have passed like swift draughts  
of the sweet mead in lofty halls  
beyond the West, beneath the blue vaults of Varda

42642,150,1,"train",1,"/r/lotr","I think this would be in line with Morpheus described as black or Hermione described as white. The source material does state this (I may be mistaken in Hermione’s case) but it is not linked to the character’s existence. Their character or purpose in the story (whether narratively or thematically) does not change if you make them white, black, biracial, Asian, etc.

Black Panther, in contrast, was created with his skin color explicitly linked to his existence. Not just the author thinking it would make a nice description or visual, but because there were few black superheroes. Black Panther is created with his skin color as one of his defining features. Being a *black* superhero is the point of his stories, whether he’s fighting the KKK or a a generic mercenary. 

I’d say that there typically are two main arguments against this in regards to elvish skin color. 

The first is being that ‘being white is important’, because their fair, white skin is what makes them beautiful and angelic. I don’t really have an argument except maybe this is a perception we should push against. Perhaps white skin = good and darker skin = bad is worth adjusting. 

The other argument is that the original intention of Tolkien’s work is to create a mythology for the U.K. (Perhaps Britain specifically? This I’m unsure of). In that vein, everyone should be white because the majority of those living in the UK are white. 

Which, is fair. My two notes on that are:

1) The original series has plenty of American Actors, which I don’t recall being an issue. I think having a someone who grew up -where- the story is supposed to provide a mythology for is more important than skin color. An Indian child growing up in a small British town may have more of a connection for the ‘intended mythology’ of Lord of the Rings than a white child in Missouri.

2) LoTR was intended as a surrogate UK/British mythology (again, I can’t recall the specifics) but it is WELL past that. It is a mythology of good vs evil, and of little people doing extraordinary things, that has been adopted into the hearts of people across the world. It’s a global mythology now, and like real mythos spreading, it’s changed to reflect the people who have adopted it.","i think this would be in line with morpheus described as black or hermione described as white the source material does state this i may be mistaken in hermiones case but it is not linked to the characters existence their character or purpose in the story whether narratively or thematically does not change if you make them white black biracial asian etc

The problem, explicitly, is that you've missed the point of the source material. Tolkien was a man who watched racism result in a genocide and fought to end it. His second book is all about how 1 race of people, standing alone, will fail and the darkness will win. 

He was staunchly anti-racist despite being born in a time when racism was the norm. Hell, he went as far as to say that racism is a sin against God.

Yet, here his most ardent fans are saying that skin color is a disqualifier for inclusion in his works. That's why what you're saying bothers me; it's exclusion exclusively due to race vs a body of work that rather explicitly called that out as a bad thing.

I’m never one to turn my nose up at Star Wars, so overall I had a great time. My one true complaint about the show is the Mando/Luke episodes completely shafting the finale. If you’re gonna do a Boba show do a Boba show. Don’t dedicate 2 episodes to the characters from your already existing wildly popular TV show and expect people to temper down for one odd episode afterwards. What’s more, those episodes kind of made Din and Grogu major players in the finale. Din I understand, but Grogu really and no reason to be incorporated into the action.

Given maybe one additional episode I feel like there could have been both a diplomatic/political resolution to the conflict as well as a physical resolution. There was a whole lot here that didn’t go anywhere. Boba never proved himself to be up to the task of a crime lord. He really didn’t react much to the news of the Tuskens (or at least he didn’t any differently on this information than he would have without knowing it).

40249,77,1,"train",1,"/r/lotr","Well, couple of things to consider.

This is the backstory of the army of the dead in the books. In the books, they never went to the Pellenor fields, they merely routed the forces of Sauron in the southern fiefs of Gondor so Aragorn could bring those soldiers north. Once that was done, Aragorn held their oath fulfilled and released them. Always be careful when applying book backstory to movie characters/events, which are often different due to expediency.

Why would Aragorn release them then? Well, He told them he would. This is not a setting in which the ends justify the means; moral and good people do things in a moral and upright way, no matter the cost to themselves. 

Also, it is worth considering that Sauron and the Witch-King were none for necromancy, the ability to influence the spirits of the dead. Besides, the dead-men are cursed because they broke their oath to Isildur to fight against Sauron because this people had worshiped Sauron. Sending ghosts of dubious loyalty to right against someone they used to venerate, who also knows something about manipulating the spirits of the dead, is a distinctly bad idea.

this is the backstory of the army of the dead in the books in the books they never went to the pellenor fields they merely routed the forces of sauron in the southern fiefs of gondor so aragorn could bring those soldiers north once that was done aragorn held their oath fulfilled and released them always be careful when applying book backstory to movie charactersevents which are often different due to expediency

why would aragorn release them then well he told them he would this is not a setting in which the ends justify the means moral and good people do things in a moral and upright way no matter the cost to themselves

Overall I liked it. Below I'm going to list a bunch of criticisms of the show, but I'm bothering to write all this up because I think these Mando/Boba shows (and potentially the upcoming shows too) have potential to be something really neat. Watching this show I get the sense that the creative decision-makers behind it actually really like Star Wars, and instead of cranking out a story formula they think will sell a lot of theatre tickets and merch (like the sequel trilogy) they are creating something that star wars fans will think is cool.

Luke and Ahsoka having a friendship of some kind? Cool. Luke training the next Yoda? Cool. Boba Fett develops into a more substantial character that's not just some edgy badass? Great. Expanded lore on Tatooine and its people and cultures? Moving along the story of Mandalore? Slowly unraveling the mystery of what Yoda's species is and what makes them so special? Absolutely tantalizing. Boba Fett riding a rancor and obliterating massive droidekas? **Fucking. awesome.**

I don't know how you can be anything but positive about any of this stuff. But, the show is clearly not a masterpiece and they have a long way to go to be in the same league as shows that are actually, you know, really good.

Here are my random specific thoughts:

**Stormtrooper continuity error in ep1**

* Opener of Ep1, Boba wakes up in the sarlacc and gets oxygen from a dead stormtrooper's suit. This is already a continuity error because **there were no stormtroopers present at the battle of Jabba's barge.** Could the sarlacc have swallowed a stormtrooper at some other time? Sure, but it would have to be pretty recent for that suit to not be dissolved and the oxy tank still functioning. But there was no empire on the planet in ROTJ so...it just makes no sense. The only explanation as far as I'm concerned is that this is a very clumsy continuity error, which is very unfortunate because it's thrown right in your face in the opening moments of the episode. A shame.

**Tatooine worldbuilding**

* Tatooine as a setting: this point isn't a criticism actually. But in recent Star Wars productions I've been getting really tired of constantly returning to Tatooine. It's supposed to be an absolute backwater in the outer rim, the definition of the middle of nowhere. But with the amount of stories that get told there, the number of significant characters who visit and important things that happen, it feels more like the center of the Star Wars universe. And honestly, I wasn't looking forward to this show having even more Tatooine. But I was pleasantly surprised. I really enjoyed the expanded lore of tusken raiders, and even getting a better sense of the planet's geopolitics, social castes, cultures and peoples...all of that was pretty fascinating. Just these 7 episodes made me go from being absolutely Tatooined out to....well, they could make it the main setting for the rest of this show and I wouldn't mind, as long as they keep up the worldbuilding that this season had.

**Character development is undercooked and that robs the show of a stable emotional core**

* I already wrote this out in longer form [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/so7z3y/comment/hwbrkdh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), but the TLDR is, character development is sort of happening but it didn't get enough screentime to make events of the show emotionally resonate the way they could. Boba especially undergoes a profound evolution, becoming basically a different person while he spends **years** with the Tuskens, (which the show makes seem like a couple weeks maybe.) While the way he acts afterward is certainly different from the Boba we know, the show somehow failed to drive home the understanding to the audience that he has undergone this seismic change in his outlook, goals and behaviour. I'm not really sure how they missed the mark, because one bit of character development that's adequately done in these episodes is the arc of his relationship to those sand people. When they're all killed, it's the saddest moment of the season and you know Boba's devastated. But there's nothing to show how deeply this affects him. We don't see him really struggle with the transition from bounty hunter to benevolent nobleman. He just stoically adapts to everything that happens and there's no sign his entire psychology is being rewired. So everyone makes this criticism of, ""he seems like a different character,"" and that's because he is, but the show failed to animate the process of that transformation.
* This same issue of undercooked character development affects other characters as well, like Fennec, whose motivation for following Boba into the civic life is a total mystery, other than basic factors like mutual respect and gratitude for saving her life. But those aren't nearly enough to explain her motivation IMHO.

**A bunch of battle logistics that made no sense in the finale**

* I am normally not a stickler for this kind of thing, so you know that if even I kept noticing this stuff, it must be pretty bad. But honestly I'm too tired after writing all the above to go into more detail about this but I'm sure lots of other people have it covered. But this was really an unfortunate distracting element in a finale that I otherwise liked a lot. I think the overall concept was 10/10, but they really stumbled in having the details play out in a logical and believable way.

**Edit: Important addition: the actual takeover/Bib Fortuna's death**

* why...the fuck....was this part shown as this really quick little dreamlike montage? I can't even remember what episode it was in now but it was so strange. Like, Bib Fortuna was a pretty memorable supporting character from ROTJ. But the weird way they decided to gloss over this part of the story didn't make, like, cinema-storytelling sense to me, if that makes sense. It was just so weird and I thought that scene was a flash-forward and we'd see it actually play out later. But nope, that was it.","i have some thoughts about the season as a whole that i want to type up while everythings still fresh in my memory

31381,139,1,"train",1,"/r/lotr","That’s a valid critique. I have three separate responses. 

The first is that it’s not really relevant to the spirit of OP’s complaint. OP is not just saying that this proposed storyline is playing out at the wrong point on the timeline, he’s saying that it’s not even Tolkienian. Commenters are responding by calling this girl-bossing. This discourse isn’t about whether or not this is a valid or invalid reorganization of the timeline…… this is about modern politics. The spirit of this post is about a perceived violation of the spirit of Tolkien in the name of pushing a modern political agenda, and the response to this post only solidifies that characterization. 

So I respond with a depoliticizing observation. Galadriel WAS the person that OP quotes the article as describing. Making her a “girl boss” is not pushing an agenda, it’s how Tolkien wrote her at one point of her life. 

Couldn’t a much more fruitful conversation be had if we got interested in discussing the merits or faults of reorganizing this timeline from the perspective of *storycraft* rather than from the perspective of modern political divisions? 

My second response is doing that, which is to say that I think it’s certainly not out of left field to move her personality growth in this way. I can see how having Galadriel as her younger personality would help meet the unique needs of show-running this story as opposed to novel-writing it. 

That doesn’t mean that I think it’s GOOD that they did so, only that it’s a valid option given the story they are trying to tell and medium through which it is being told. The merits of that choice, story-wise, can be debated independently. 

And lastly, I think we are still prone to overestimate her character growth. We forget that the Galadriel we knew is not Galadriel as she was…. It is Galadriel as she was seen through the eyes of a hobbit. Lord of the Rings (as well as the legendarium as a whole) is brought to us by a deliberately unreliable narrator. That’s a choice that Tolkien went out of his way for and took great care to stress, and we can see him treating his own text through the lens of the unreliable narrator. 

And that’s what elevates the story to a whole new level. It’s a *good* thing that we are given permission by this literary device to read new meanings into the text and speculate about how it may have been “for real” once you strip away the mythification and idealization of the narrators.","thats a valid critique i have three separate responses

Remember, while they are heroes in our story, Mando, Fett, and Fennec are all garbage from the point of view of Luke and the Republic.  They are the villains from a certain point of view.

I'm excited to hear it and feel it, and didn't expect him to get involved to be honest. Music has always been one of the most important aspects of filmmaking to me personally.

You might already be aware, but trailers are a whole industry of its own, and in trailers the music is almost never composed and produced by the composer of the film itself. This teaser likely had custom ordered music, so it is made for purpose, but it's still very much in the trailer music industry world in style. Trailer music is like film music on steroids generally, and tends to rely on simplicity and immediate attention and effectiveness. It's both a proven working approach and a hindrance of course. There's a reason it's become so popular, but it's also a bit limiting in stylistic and artistic terms. 

What that does mean, however, is that the trailer music is not really representative of the music in the series. It's made by different people for marketing specifically. So a Shore score is sure to change the tone of the show quite a bit. 

Again, the music made for the teaser is amazingly well done and produced. I really don't want to sound like I think I did a better job here musically speaking, or that they did not do a great job. It's just a different approach to see how it feels, and this sort of an approach was most likely not even an option to the composer from the brief they got.","i agree on the importance of music one of my favourite things about the show at the moment is that howard shore is scoring it im excited to hear it and feel it and didnt expect him to get involved to be honest music has always been one of the most important aspects of filmmaking to me personally

39980,117,1,"train",1,"/r/lotr","The circumstances for both trilogies were difficult, although I have to say, that while LotR had the harder pitch Hobbit had the more difficult production. Peter Jackson poured his heart and soul i to those movies and it was important to him to get it right - which really shows, but with Hobbit he had to do a last minute job and the studio constantly interfered. That combined with some of his own bad decisions created the mess those movies are now. I love them as LotR prequels, they work well as what they are supposed to be after all, but as actual adaptations of the Hobbit, those are very bad. The first one I think suffers the least under the circumstances, while the second one set the rails for the bad direction the third one had to go on. I love Azog as a villain, I dont mind the CGI and I do love big battles, but damn that third movie messed the battle up. Up to the point of the battle I'd say the movie holds up, decently but Smaug was so wasted after the big setup of the second movie and the strategy of that battle was...interesting?

Lmao, uh no. If you've seen anything of JJ Abrams you know he throws a bunch of questions up in the air and it's usually up to whoever comes afterward to answer and tie things together. Apparently the one time before TRoS he actually finished something he took the story back to the status quo, aka undoing everything that was said previous... Just like TRoS.

I always bring up this analogy when it comes to writing a three-part story or trilogy. If I came to you and said that I wanted you to write the middle part of the story and I told you

>""Once upon a time there was a man named Larry. Larry was pretty hungry and his favorite food was pasta, so he went to the store.""

what would you write? Well honestly you could write about anything as long as it related to what I had. You can write about how he buys ingredients for Kraft mac and cheese. You can maybe change some things up and say that he makes some kind of vietnamese dish. You can even add ingredients and spices and other dishes no one was expecting. Either way, it builds from before and though some people won't agree with what dish you choose, you still managed to tie it together.

Now if I come back and say

>""Actually he was hungry for blood so he went back to the store and killed all the secret alien humans and feasted on their brains and became the strongest man ever!""

who do you blame for fucking up the story? Yes, you could certainly blame the idea that nothing was planned from the start and that it was maybe not the smartest idea for you to finish the middle part and for me to finish the first and last part. However, it doesn't take a genius to build upon previous storylines and come up with a satisfying conclusion. Rian Johnson set up several storylines and story beats as a jumping off point for a new story, regardless if you agreed with any of them or not. JJ Abrams just decided to ignore most of it, retcon some of it, and then go off the wall bonkers with a twist that made absolutely no sense.

He is mostly at fault. It's still baffles me how a previous writer can basically set up a blank slate for you to write any movie without relying on nostalgia and quoting previous films, and yet you somehow twist it back into a nostalgia, fanfiction, mess.","its also hilarious how fans peddle the idea jj had a plan and rj ruined it

Galadriel, Melian, and Luthien all personify immensely important women of their time.  They braved extraordinary circumstances to represent their own interests and defend themselves, their families, and their people. Galadriel risked the Wrath of the Valar and stood against centuries of darkness. Melian guarded among the most important kingdoms of its time. Luthien's story was immortalized for her bravery defying Morgoth's servants, with Beren returning a Silmaril back to the Valar. 

Arwen grew up knowing those stories and participating in events in her own way. Okay, Tolkien didn't write an elaborate story of her that a similar author might have today -- but to act like she's useless and best in the background weaving a damn flag is so nonsensical. Arwen playing a somewhat more central role in the movies doesn't bother me in the least, not the least because she was part of an enormously important tradition of women heroically involved in Middle Earth (Galadriel, Celebrian, etc.) that makes her story plausible.

We have a generation of girls and women able to look at the story and see themselves represented in the greater story that Tolkien wrote. That's important.","whats kind of hilarious to me is how powerful arwen and galadriel are if you read the silmarillion and everything else 

galadriel melian and luthien all personify immensely important women of their time  they braved extraordinary circumstances to represent their own interests and defend themselves their families and their people galadriel risked the wrath of the valar and stood against centuries of darkness melian guarded among the most important kingdoms of its time luthiens story was immortalized for her bravery defying morgoths servants with beren returning a silmaril back to the valar 

arwen grew up knowing those stories and participating in events in her own way okay tolkien didnt write an elaborate story of her that a similar author might have today  but to act like shes useless and best in the background weaving a damn flag is so nonsensical arwen playing a somewhat more central role in the movies doesnt bother me in the least not the least because she was part of an enormously important tradition of women heroically involved in middle earth galadriel celebrian etc that makes her story plausible

great horns she had and behind her short stalklike neck was her huge swollen body a vast bloated bag swaying and sagging between her legs its great bulk was black blotched with livid marks but the belly underneath was pale and luminous and gave forth a stench her legs were bent with great knobbed joints high above her back and hairs that stuck out like steel spines and at each legs end there was a claw

43491,160,1,"train",1,"/r/lotr","Honestly, it was a shock for a few days but then life went on. If you didn’t have family or friends that were directly impacted, you just followed the news and people were on tv pontificating about how there were “great evils” in the world we needed to fight but you mostly ignored it. 

Obviously it still dominated the news but we didn’t sit around watching the news 24 hours a day. There were way bigger turnouts at blood drives for a few weeks after. That’s about it. 

It maybe came up once a week in conversation. If that. I didn’t know anyone personally involved so at the time the thought was that it would blow over. 

Two months later came the invasion of Afghanistan. It was marketed as a swift, surgical military action to extradite bin Laden and stabilize the Taliban supply lines. We were hearing all this news about how badly the civilian population lived under them, and there was a lot of talk about international humanitarian aid and giving those people better lives. All of which would be achieved in a couple months of course. 

So we thought, “OK great humanitarian intervention, plus swift decisive action and we get justice for 9/11 so soon we can all move on”. I remember considering dropping out of college temporarily just so I could enlist and be part of a humanitarian aid force. Fortunately my mom convinced me otherwise. 

Then Bush redirected all of this back to Iraq, and the UN weapons inspector thing had been going on since the summer. Really it was just kind of a minor annoyance that the UN inspectors were getting some pushback, they had cooperation just not as much as they wanted, they didn’t feel like it was that big of a deal but Bush jumped on it. And there was no support behind it until 9/11, after that the hawks  were getting louder and there was something wrong with you if you spoke against them. 

It was really not until mid 2002 when things started looking bad.  Bush failed to get a UN resolution to invade Iraq, but he started really harping on 9/11 as justification for the US to do it on our own. And we had scary things like the vice president talking on national tv about how he supported torture in order to get confessions. It felt like over the next 2 to 3 years there was some sort of cultural shift - because as long as what we were doing good in some conceivable way be justified with 9/11 that we could  do no wrong. 

But it really took a couple years to settle in. For the first few months things felt pretty normal and aside from the tragedy of the lives lost no one else was really affected. Travel felt weird but mostly it felt like the people who were supposed to prevent this kind of thing fucked up, people died and it was horrible, but people died all around the world from things in the 90’s and we would hear about it in the news and say “Aw that’s awful” and then move on with life.","honestly it was a shock for a few days but then life went on if you didnt have family or friends that were directly impacted you just followed the news and people were on tv pontificating about how there were great evils in the world we needed to fight but you mostly ignored it

28504,262,1,"train",1,"/r/lotr","I'll answer as best as I can:

1. Sauron put the majority of his power into the ring to anchor him to the world and bind all the other rings to his will. Sauron is a being of energy that makes a physical body for himself. When he had the ring taken from him his body didn't have enough power to keep itself together.
2. Their biology DOES make their feet large, also the tops tend to be thick with fur like an animal to keep them warm and the bottom of their feet are harder than boot leather. Frodo stomping out the fire the twins made with his foot wasn't an act of self-destructive desperation, it was what a hobbit could safely do. 
3. They are otherworldly, caught between life and death. Their words are dreadful and their speech black. For all we know they are actually talking without making the effort to be understood by men. 
4. The elements have their champions, the ring wraiths don't like water and it takes a lot to force them over water.
5. Wizards are not ALLOWED to channel their powers except through their staffs. Wizards are actually angels allowed to take physical form and help/enable the forces of middle earth. Each has their own task set forth by their archangel as well as an overarching ""try to make the world a better place"" goal. If a wizard tries to use their powers without a staff they die from a failsafe. 
6. Because the ring wraiths are stuck, they can't grow and are in stasis. The blade disappeared to reappear at the side of the ringwraith, as it always does, as it always will do. They are locked. 
7. Elves are lighter, and they have some horse energy. A light as a feather elf speaking the language of the horses carrying a hobbit is faster than even a ranger who weighs more.
8. Yes they are afraid of water, but also that river marks the border of the lands Elrond holds, you see them get slapped down for trying to enter in the next part.
9. There have been three ages of middle earth, the first was the elves coming over and everything being INSANELY AWESOME but also terrifying. Elves crafted kingdoms, rules continents, and entire armies of elves fought each other or the terrors of Sauron's master. There was a dragon larger than mount doom that got beat by a guy flying a sailing boat using the power of a gem filled with the last lights of the trees of golden and silver light that were eventually used to make the sun and moon... Second age was the elves trying to keep things going the way they liked it and failing, third age is the age of nostalgia where the elves are feeling the weight of their years and eventually want to leave the now boring middle earth and go back to the undying lands where archangels literally hold court or teach elves how to craft things. 
10. Nothing evil likes the light of the sun, but only a few things are actually killed by it. Saruman is breeding stronger orcs that are organized and less tribal barbarians and more primitive organized military. They are physically stronger by a little bit and hardier which makes them more likely to fight in daylight than others. 
11. Frodo is bound to the ring because he wore it. Even though it didn't hurt the ring, the ring still sent out a ""HEY SOMEONE JUST TOOK A SHOT AT ME!"" to get someone to pick it up.
12. Could be anything, there are a bunch of languages. Maybe elven, but the fact that Saruman is an angel that used to work for the archangel of the winds themselves means he might actually be speaking the language of the wind.
13. That isn't direct sunlight, it might be reflected light from something else, the moon, lanterns, or etc. It seems like there needs to be direct a to b sunlight though as the trolls weren't turned to stone by ambient rays from the dawn until the sun itself shown directly on them.
