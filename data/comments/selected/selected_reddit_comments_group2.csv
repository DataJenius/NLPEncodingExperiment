The very first scene of the lord of the rings is sauron demolishing dozens of people with a mace, then deciding to reach out with his vulnerable hand holding the ring that gives him all of his power towards a guy with a sword. That to me is far less believable than a black elf existing. 

By your logic any fantasy world established before about 2010 needs to stay white forever for consistency. 

Of course it will be a somewhat generic fantasy tv show, the original movies weren't exactly niche hidden gem films themselves.","adding racial diversity is not changing things for the sake of changing things its bringing a story into the modern era having black people in a show detracts nothing from it imo and is hardly the least believable thing about any of this story

1) Boba makes an informed decision to hold out at the Palace where all of their gear and vehicles are. He is then “persuaded” by two street dwellers to hold out inside a building that was recently bombed. Structural integrity alone makes this a bad idea. 

2) The Pyke Syndicate killed the Tusken tribe, not Cad like everyone thought. The reason Cad should have been that person will be brought up later. This is just a bad plot structure point for me. 

3) Luke sent Grogu and R2-D2 in his X-Wing back to Tatooine. Grogu was technically by himself. Seems slightly petty and irresponsible for a Jedi to get rid of a student with a toddler mentality. 

4) They split their personal reinforcements up in the wake of a war. Plus, sending Krrysantan to Trandoshians territory after he senselessly attacked and dismembered a group of Trandoshians is just a terrible idea. Right after Fennic says there will be no surprises because of this, Cad Bane is outside with sniper reinforcement. Good job!

5) The locals begin attacking their recon crews. This leads to the mod squad getting cornered, Krrysantan getting surrounded and dog piled by Mark Zuckerberg relatives, and the Gamorreans pushed off a cliff. First off, Krrysantan had a freaking blaster and gets beaten by a bunch of lizard people with swords. Also, the Gamorreans get little to no respect for their death even though they were a ride or die for Boba. They aren’t even mentioned following the teams victory. 

6) Fennics rescue of the Mod Squad was laughable. She posted up 5 feet above their location and then did a slow mo front flip to the ground before mounting her speeder. Also, her “Manners….I like it.” line was cringey. It was only missing a wink before speeding off. 

7) Mando and Bobas bro love moment was good. The two of them literally fighting in the open street vice taking cover or using their jet packs to flank or outmaneuver on the roof tops was bad in generally. Boys, you are putting too much trust in your Plot, I mean, Beskar Armor. 

8) Freetowns reinforcements roll up which consisted of 10 towns folk. 10 non-soldiers was the force decided to save Boba and his people against the Pykes. We had episodes of Tusken Tribes which probably ranges in the hundreds (maybe thousands) but Freetown is the designated saviors. 

9) Mod squad Vespa reinforcements was slow as always and stacked up in the SAME exact place as Boba, Mando, and the 10 Freetownians. The two mods that Boba took tactical advice pre-battle now joined in on a freaking killzone. Brilliant!

10) Let’s pump the brakes real quick. Krrysantan is going to join the killzone too after receiving an axe wound and SEVEN blaster shots to various body parts and armor. 

11) Out come the Heavy Assault Droids (Scorpenek Droids I think they were called). They look great, shields were great. Our band of misfit heroes shoot at the droids for FORTY FIVE SECONDS (I’m timing it). In this time, they can’t figure out they are wasting their time and neither droid takes a single shot (not that that will make a difference). 

12) Mando tries using the Dark Saber. This would have been awesome if he didn’t fail miserably followed by “I can’t get through.” No shit, boba witnessed you bro. Also, why are they having a conversation right next to these two “tanks” that are trying to kill them?

13) Boba flies away hopefully for something practical. Mando runs away instead of flying. Makes sense. 

14) The entire army runs in a giant line down a straight road with a giant killer droid behind them. Luckily, the only thing the droid can hit is the road. 

15) Krrysantan may have a moment of revelation as he thinks he can penetrate the barrier. Just kidding. He is kicked by the droid and then left alone as the droid leaves to pester the other denizens. Also, Krrysantan is magically healed of all wounds. 

16) Probably the most cringe moment of the series was Skad doing a 360 synchronize shot with Drash and Krrysantan. Who green lit that illegal spin. It’s not even a 360 no scope because his eye is a damn scope. 

17) Peli driving up in a rickshaw not knowing there is a battle going on is just lazy writing. Playing it off as her being deaf is even lazier. 

18) The misfits hold out at the Alamo which has plaster walls made of Beskar (probably). The droids blew up an armored vehicle for god sakes. The wall will hold though. 

19) THE BIGGEST DISSERVICE TO MANDALORIAN SEASON 3 Is the fact Mando and Grogu reunite in a fucking rickshaw with the 15 seconds of emotion and Mando telling him to sit his ass down so they can get blown up. A critical story point that should have been in Mando Season 3 is wasted on a subpar finale based on Boba. Thanks Disney. Also he chose the chainmail, sweet. /s

20) The only issue I have with the Rancor fight is the injury, or lack there of, sustained by the droids. This is obviously where the entire episode budget went because it looked fantastic. 

21) Grogus shining moment isn’t to implode the droid, but to remove joint piece from its leg and being shotgunned across the road from its impact. Thanks chainmail. 

22) Skad requires his robo eye to see the two on the roof 20 feet away. Drash proceeds to distract the Scorpenek droid right next to the person she is providing a distraction for. That is not how distractions work. And why did she need the cycler rifle for this? She is not doing any precision shooting. 

23) A minor CGI slip from the Rancors final kill. Droid went from 1 blaster to 2 blasters and back to 1 blaster. Not a deal breaker for me though. Shout out to the CGI artist. The droids and Rancor look phenomenal. 

24) Final droid barrier shooting time was 4:24 seconds. Learn quicker shooters. They are lucky the droids had a body count of ZERO. Who ever manufactured these pieces of shit war machine need to refund the Pykes. 

25) Boba survives fighting 2 kaiju fights on the rancor but Cad manages to knock him off with a wrist flame thrower. This also is enough to scare the rancor away. Riiiiiight. 

26) Cad Bane is one of the most renowned bounty hunters in the galaxy and they decided to give him maybe 5 minutes of total screen time before “killing” him off. There is no practical way Mando would have gotten the drop from his position to disarm Cad. I tried it in my living room with a broom. It’s not happening. And the last dying breath of Cad is auto tuned. Why did they do my boy like that. 

27) Rancor Kong scene was a little heavy handed. Mando jumps in and makes fool of himself again. Boba is no where to be seen to handle his pet he set loose, and Grogu ends up napping with it. Why didn’t Boba use Slave 1 to fight this battle again? 

28) Fennics assassination scene was the highlight for me. Lynching the mayor and killing the Pyke leader was badass. Why Fennec though? They killed Bobas tribe. This is Bobas “book” if you will. Why is Fennec killing off the revenge plot? Why isn’t Fennec the Daimyo?

29) Why does everyone respect Boba at the end after bringing a large scale battle to their city, setting a rancor loose to destroy a large section of their city, and causing a huge divide between the ruling houses?

30) The Wookiee still doesn’t get a medal. He gets a fucking melon. 

31) How did Cobb get to the Bacta tank so quickly. Why did he get the post credit scene over, let say, a crimson dawn homage for season 2, Cad Bane surviving, or something worth while. I think 95% of the people knew Cobb survived his blaster injury. We didn’t need his bacta scene. 

32) Why does Robert Rodriguez hate Star Wars?

Jokes aside, I appreciate that people liked this episode. I personally didn’t but that is besides the point. I am bitter about the lazy writing they provided the entire season and how it disservices such an iconic figure. Hopefully season 2 will learn from season 1 mistakes. 

(Also I apologize if there are grammatical, name, or scenario mistakes. I’m not going through and proof reading all of this.)","hold my beer please

could not breed and produce fertile offspring – even as a rare event : **there are 2 cases** only in my legends of such unions, and they are merged in the descendants of Eärendil

>The film was based on God Particle, a spec script from Oren Uziel which had the main plot of the space station crew, but was unconnected to Cloverfield. The script was acquired by Paramount Pictures and Bad Robot in 2012. It had been initially planned as part of Paramount's low-budget InSurge distribution label, but following the folding of that label, its production was expanded as a Paramount-distributed film. Only during production did Abrams decide to link the film to Cloverfield, adapting Uziel's screenplay and adding scenes to establish the connection, after the same approach was used to alter 10 Cloverfield Lane from its original script, The Cellar. Abrams saw the particle accelerator accident as a cinematic means for future events to cause changes in the past, narratively linking the Cloverfield franchise together.

3511,201,2,"train",0,"/r/StarWars","> He never showed any attachment to him, he was just the only one who could sense the good still inside him. 

Um, guy, *that is attachment*.

He believed there was good in Vader in spite of overwhelming evidence to the contrary and, really, just by virtue of Vader being his dad and a former Jedi.

It’s clear Luke has Daddy (and probably abandonment) issues.

> His attachment to Leia almost caused him to kill his father and fall to the dark side, before remembering that he had to trust his senses that his father would not allow him to be killed by the emperor.

I swear y’all weren’t paying attention when watching this movie. That *isn’t what happened*. Luke gives in to his emotions and lashes out at Vader for threatening Leia. After defeating Vader, Luke looks from Vader’s severed robotic hand to Luke’s own. He realizes he’s going down the path Anakin did. He’s becoming his father. And so when the Emperor tells Luke to kill Vader and take his place, Luke refuses. He does what Anakin could not. He rejects the Emperor and becomes a true Jedi. This is spitefully acknowledged by the Emperor.

Luke had no idea Vader would save him. He had no idea that the Emperor could even hurt him. Luke’s naive ass thought he’d won. He didn’t trust Vader to save him, he begged him to while being tortured. And, just like Luke chose good over evil, Jedi over Sith, so to does Vader. He chooses his son over the Emperor. Luke didn’t know that was gonna happen. Vader didn’t even know that was gonna happen. He made a choice.

> I don’t think attachments have ever been presented as a good thing in Star Wars. 

I literally just explained an instance where they were. Luke believed there was good in his father when he had no reason to and his faith was rewarded. Luke caring about a man he had every reason to hate saved the fucking galaxy.

> The message for Jedi has always been letting go of what you fear to lose. Anakin couldn’t do that, Luke could.

Lol. What? Luke didn’t let go of shit. RotJ ends with him celebrating with all his loved ones. You’ve somehow completely misunderstood Star Wars. The things Anakin did to covet and protect his attachments turned him evil. He became angry, jealous, fearful, etc. Luke doesn’t allow himself to tread the same path. He sees that he is after defeating Vader and chooses good instead.

You can see a parallel between Anakin and Luke in RotS and RotJ. They each make a pivotal decision and are offered to join the Emperor.

Anakin betrays the Jedi and joins Sidious. Luke commits to the Jedi and rejects Sidious.

Luke is what Anakin was not.

Luke maintains attachments but does not allow himself to be corrupted to have them.

Granted, it helps that, for Luke, they weren’t explicitly forbidden but I digress.","he never showed any attachment to him he was just the only one who could sense the good still inside him

 Who? The Lord of the Rings books follow the story of the Fellowship of the Ring as they work to destroy the One Ring. Eventually they are split into several factions of sorts, Sam and Frodo on the direct path to Mordor, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli in Rohan, and Gandalf in Minas Tirith. Merry and Pippin have their own miscellaneous events that lead to them being pushed in with either Rohan or Gandalf.

 Boromir dies at Amon Hen attempting to save the Hobbits. 

 There are no main characters missing. When you really look at the films, they had incredibly minute changes. The key story beats still happen. Weathertop is identical, Rivendell is identical minus a party, Carahadras is identical, Moria is identical minus a few hours of walking. Lorien is identical, Amon Hen is identical, the Breaking of the Fellowship is identical.

You're not going to win support for your causes, if that's your go-to method everytime someone disagrees with you on issues like this.

We are all monkeys who originated from Africa and all our ancestors skins were beautiful black.

Multiculturalism and racial diversity in general are not what I am opposing here. I am opposing this phenomenon that seems to be strictly american, something I have preferred as an american cultural imperialism. If this shit wouldn't be exported and preached to us so high and mighty, I wouldn't give a shit.

If Tolkien created a world where different looking persons mainly inhabited different parts of the world, as was the case before industrialization that shrinked the world drastically, turning that world to represent a modern day racial harmony and having a diverse outlook of people is bastardization of his world building.

stop them from bringing in ships and just laying waste to Mos Eisley,

14654,341,2,"train",1,"/r/lotr",">That's just wrong... If you think the stories of Gollum, or Boromir, or Denethor, or Saruman, or Rhun and Harad, or even the internal conflict of other characters, is black and white, you probably didn't read Tolkien's work carefully. Also, what does realism have to do in a high fantasy mythology?

We get almost no details about rhun or harad. Saruman I'd argue is very black and white. That being said, I didn't say that every detail of every character is black and white, but Tolkien's stories are very much a general good v evil in general. There are very very few people in these stories doing morally grey things. Compare that to game of thrones where much of what occurs is morally grey. Lotr doesn't have a lot of discussion about how an individual act may benefit this group of people while hurting this group - not in a way where you have a difficult time making the choice as a reader. Almost every choice or tradeoff in lotr comes down to benefitting the good, or benefitting the evil side. There's very clear lines. It is a story of good vs evil at it's core. Game of thrones on the other hand is very much not that, and reflects the realities that every person or group of people have interests. Often times those interests are at odds with a different group. You can pick a favorite, but at some point your favorite person or group of people make a choice that benefits them in a way that carries a negative impact to some other person or group that far outweighs the gain to that person. The reality that very rarely are situations simply a tradeoff between good and evil. 

I'm not suggesting one is better than the other. I don't always want that level of 'realism' in my story telling. I'm just saying, there's a very clear difference in the type of stories these two men wanted to tell.

>That's false. Just because Tolkien doesn't overload us with descriptions doesn't mean he has insufficient descriptions. Read his descriptions of Aragorn, Theoden, Denethor etc, and tell me his descriptions are lacking. He describes enough, leaving room for an individual's mind to imagine it. The only reason there is confusion is because Tolkien kept updating his Legendarium

Again, the fact that he describes a couple people in detail isn't indicative of his style as a whole, which means far more into the 'leaving room for an individual's mind to imagine' than painting a clear picture. Look at the current debate between people here about elves and hair length. Did fair mean pale skin or simply attractive? Did elves have pointed ears? One would imagine that these should be fairly easy questions to answer due to the volume of written text by Tolkien - but they're not easy to answer. That's because, as I stated above, Tolkien doesn't describe everything and definitely relies on the reader to fill in these fairly large gaps. 

As I said before, Tolkien is a super detail oriented person when it comes to things he cares about, like language. He's not super detailed in describing what most folks in his stories actually look like. You highlighted three kings. One of the things Tolkien cares about outside of language is the goodness of his characters. For Tolkien, he describes this in large part with height. He describes this a bit with attractiveness. He describes this with how closely folks resemble elves. 

Many many authors take it upon themselves to describe any character in pretty good detail, enough so that a group of people imagining that character should imagine them fairly similarly. Tolkien often describes people more by the impact they have on others. Are they beautiful? Are they imposing? And then he lets the reader decide largely what beautiful is to them, or what an imposing character might look like. 

Again, not saying he doesn't provide any level of character specific description, but that's less common for Tolkien than for most.

>This is besides the point. Martin tried to critique Tolkien thematically, and failed.

I would argue that you think he failed because you, as a reader, care about the things Tolkien wrote about. Other readers might care a lot about the things Martin called out, like the lack of aragorns tax code. I personally don't care nearly as much about the singing voice of an elf as samwise gamgee does, but I would personally like a lot more information on what made aragorn a 'good' king.

Tolkien assumes (well he states, he's God of the universe, he doesn't have to assume) that aragorns reign was a great one. But again, he doesn't describe why it was great. That's left to the reader. You and I and Sally at the bus stop probably have 3 different perspectives on what would make a leader great. For some it might be peace. For others it might be conquering others. For some it might mean feeding and housing the poor. For others it might be ensuring the stability of the nobility and ruling houses. 

For Tolkien's writing, it doesn't always matter. He probably doesn't care what aragorn did specifically. To simply say he was good, that leaves the reader to assume that those things they view as good are those things that aragorn would achieve. 

I'm speaking generally as well. I'm aware that Tolkien did actually describe in a few sentences the wars and eventual peace that aragorn achieved. War or no war were just a couple of the first things that jumped into my mind as two sides of a coin and people who would support one or the other in a good king.","thats just wrong if you think the stories of gollum or boromir or denethor or saruman or rhun and harad or even the internal conflict of other characters is black and white you probably didnt read tolkiens work carefully also what does realism have to do in a high fantasy mythology

we get almost no details about rhun or harad saruman id argue is very black and white that being said i didnt say that every detail of every character is black and white but tolkiens stories are very much a general good v evil in general there are very very few people in these stories doing morally grey things compare that to game of thrones where much of what occurs is morally grey lotr doesnt have a lot of discussion about how an individual act may benefit this group of people while hurting this group  not in a way where you have a difficult time making the choice as a reader almost every choice or tradeoff in lotr comes down to benefitting the good or benefitting the evil side theres very clear lines it is a story of good vs evil at its core game of thrones on the other hand is very much not that and reflects the realities that every person or group of people have interests often times those interests are at odds with a different group you can pick a favorite but at some point your favorite person or group of people make a choice that benefits them in a way that carries a negative impact to some other person or group that far outweighs the gain to that person the reality that very rarely are situations simply a tradeoff between good and evil

At least those movies are *about* something.

It mostly works. JJ Abrams can make exactly one type of movie, and he did this one well. It’s exactly what he’s good at. 

TLJ is a beautifully shot and directed character study of a film, that really works to examine what Star Wars has to say and what The Jedi really stand for and are all about, and asks some pointed and ambitious questions about the franchise and the characters as a whole. It sets the stage for a potentially incredibly interesting finale, that could have really pushed Star Wars as a movie franchise forward in new exciting ways.

It wasn’t the same way as Boromir with his vision he of uniting the Free Peoples in a huge counter to Sauron. And as you said: Faramir acted on this temptation, so yeah, I don’t think you could say he resisted it.

This isn’t about expecting or not. This is about Frodo, who clearly cannot be trustedto fulfil the quest because he comes out of his hiding place himself, and offers the One Ring to a Nazgul. Furthermore, Sam failed to prevent this so has proven already that he cannot keep an eye on Frodo all the time. Without Faramir’s intervention, everything would be lost.

In other words, you send the Ringbearer towards Mordor, and in the event that they meet one of the Nazgul drinking his tea half a mile away, there is a very real possibility Frodo will just go up to him and offers him the Ring before the Ringwraith could finish his second cupcake. This has nothing to do with “being unexpected”, but about Frodo proving himself to be incompetence (another major flaw in the movie script).

Yes, even in the books there is criticism about the mission. However, Frodo has proven himself to be a worthy Ringbearer – holding his own in three incredibly dangerous situations before he reached Rivendell, which was proof of his worthiness to the Council of Elrong – and didn’t act like an incompetent fool before Faramir, but as a person that knows what he’s doing, with a clear goal in mind.

Just a few examples from the 2001 [thread](https://www.thetolkienforum.com/threads/what-change-in-the-movies-ticks-you-off-the-most.429/):

>I'm not so much angry at the changes as I am in the way that Peter Jackson is speaking out of both sides of his mouth. He claims that he is being true to the Characters as J.R.R. wrote them, and that he is a huge fan and wouldn't make radical alteration to the mass media, and then attempting to smooth the feathers of the Real fan base by explaining and making statements that NEVER get the attention of the mass media. It's as though there are TWO of him.  
>  
>He's playing a game...he's trying to keep the public ill informed so that they believe he is a genius...that he has created the definative movies from the books, and yet those of us who really DO see the books as wonderous gifts, portals to a completely different world inhabbited by marvelous characters who have real motivations and are aware of the deep and glorious history of their world, instead of a really neat bunch of stories to make money off of.

&#x200B;

>my complaint is with Peter Jackson, New Line Cinema and the major media outlets all making the claim that Peter Jackson is a genius and a true Tolkien purist who is working his hardest at bringing the definative telling of this story, and succeeding in creating Tolkien's intent and vision of the tale for the big screen. The ploy is quite obviously designed to convince the general public that this is going to be a direct screen adaptation of the original story and characters, and that Peter Jackson is some sort of mesianic wunderkind who read every chapter straight out of the book along with the cast before shooting the corresponding scene, then create a diatribe about how some Tolkien Scholar was wowed by the sets, and how the crew is painstakingly creating Swords and Props that have Elvish inscribed on them that actually MEANS something, yet not word one to address things like Peter Jackson INVENTING dialog, changing characters for no good reason and all the time bragging that he is being true to the Author's Characters and Story...

>and here comes P.J. and his press department spinning tales of how this Director is going all out to reproduce the books in true form, when he has tossed many of these rules and laws out the window out of fear that an audience would be too stupid...or too uptight...or have too short of an attention span to ever accept, let alone enjoy the story that was voted one of the top ten greatest of the past millenium, and tell it in the manner that the author employed to thrill MILLIONS of readers since it's publication...

&#x200B;

>From the many quotes I've seen from PJ and actors, they have a pretty warped idea of ""lover of the books"" and ""staying true to the story"". What a load of two-sided, speaking out of both sides of the mouth, drivel!

Also keep in mind that PJ had 3 books to work with while the RoP show seems to only have the Appendices and whatever references to the Second Age that appeared in the LoTR/Hobbit books. They might be able to use The Silmarillion and other things for a general guidance, but I'm not sure to what extent they can use them directly since they don't really have the rights. So, like it or not, the show's gonna be a very different type of adaptation. If that's an absolute deal breaker for you, it's fine. But for everyone else, it's better to adjust expectation and try not to compare everything to the trilogy since they aren't meant to be the same kind of thing from the very beginning.

But let's be honest, the only stories in Tolkien's work that can be readily adapted into movies/shows without too much change or filling in the blanks are LoTR and (to a lesser extent) The Hobbit. Everything else is basically like chronicles or encyclopedia entries or just short mythology tales without much detail. If people don't want Tolkien adaptations to fill in blanks, then the only type of adaptations they'll be ever able to appreciate are those of LoTR and Hobbit. It's fine if that's what they want, but I for one would love to see more of Tolkien's world be translated onto the screen, even if it means things have to be changed or added.","the funny thing is this is exactly the kind of interviews some purist fans hated the most because they believed that pj and the hollywood marketing caign were lying and manipulating the public into thinking that the movies were faithful to the books when they werent at least in their minds just a few exles from the  threadim not so much angry at the changes as i am in the way that peter jackson is speaking out of both sides of his mouth he claims that he is being true to the characters as jrr wrote them and that he is a huge fan and wouldnt make radical alteration to the mass media and then attempting to smooth the feathers of the real fan base by explaining and making statements that never get the attention of the mass media its as though there are two of him  
  
hes playing a gamehes trying to keep the public ill informed so that they believe he is a geniusthat he has created the definative movies from the books and yet those of us who really do see the books as wonderous gifts portals to a completely different world inhabbited by marvelous characters who have real motivations and are aware of the deep and glorious history of their world instead of a really neat bunch of stories to make money off of

xb

my complaint is with peter jackson new line cinema and the major media outlets all making the claim that peter jackson is a genius and a true tolkien purist who is working his hardest at bringing the definative telling of this story and succeeding in creating tolkiens intent and vision of the tale for the big screen the ploy is quite obviously designed to convince the general public that this is going to be a direct screen adaptation of the original story and characters and that peter jackson is some sort of mesianic wunderkind who read every chapter straight out of the book along with the cast before shooting the corresponding scene then create a diatribe about how some tolkien scholar was wowed by the sets and how the crew is painstakingly creating swords and props that have elvish inscribed on them that actually means something yet not word one to address things like peter jackson inventing dialog changing characters for no good reason and all the time bragging that he is being true to the authors characters and story

xb

and here comes pj and his press department spinning tales of how this director is going all out to reproduce the books in true form when he has tossed many of these rules and laws out the window out of fear that an audience would be too stupidor too uptightor have too short of an attention span to ever accept let alone enjoy the story that was voted one of the top ten greatest of the past millenium and tell it in the manner that the author employed to thrill millions of readers since its publication

xb

from the many quotes ive seen from pj and actors they have a pretty warped idea of lover of the books and staying true to the story what a load of twosided speaking out of both sides of the mouth drivel

also keep in mind that pj had  books to work with while the rop show seems to only have the appendices and whatever references to the second age that appeared in the lotrhobbit books they might be able to use the silmarillion and other things for a general guidance but im not sure to what extent they can use them directly since they dont really have the rights so like it or not the shows gonna be a very different type of adaptation if thats an absolute deal breaker for you its fine but for everyone else its better to adjust expectation and try not to compare everything to the trilogy since they arent meant to be the same kind of thing from the very beginning

but lets be honest the only stories in tolkiens work that can be readily adapted into moviesshows without too much change or filling in the blanks are lotr and to a lesser extent the hobbit everything else is basically like chronicles or encyclopedia entries or just short mythology tales without much detail if people dont want tolkien adaptations to fill in blanks then the only type of adaptations theyll be ever able to appreciate are those of lotr and hobbit its fine if thats what they want but i for one would love to see more of tolkiens world be translated onto the screen even if it means things have to be changed or added"

11263,182,2,"train",0,"/r/StarWars","This is gonna be unpopular on this subreddit, but Jesus Christ… What a terrible finale.

The overall craftsmanship of this episode was terrible. I literally don’t understand how that happened when Star Wars is known for that above all else. The art direction, the CGI, and even the makeup and prosthetics were all such a let down. Idk what happened here but either Disney didn’t give them enough money, or the people behind the show had no idea how to use it.

And the directing was non-existent. It truly felt like there was just people in rooms talking, not really to each other, but just talking. And this is amplified in all the action scenes. When the Rancor finally comes out, the camera cuts to citizens slowly crouching down, as if they didn’t just see a giant monster climb a wall towards them. Same thing happened when the Rancor started fighting the giant robot. Everyone was just sort of standing there. Like the actors weren’t at all sure what they were reacting to. Or when the kid street gang comes in, the female one revs her bike and literally her speed doesn’t change… There was absolutely no care brought into this show for the little details and it’s so disappointing.

Then you just have the terrible, *terrible*, writing that has plagued the entire season. The entire season had no sense of identity. It didn’t know if it wanted to tell the story of how Boba survived after almost getting eaten, or if it wanted to tell the story of him taking control of Mos Espa, or if it wanted to continue The Mandalorian’s story. 

Even now we have no clear idea what Fett’s motivations are. Cade Bane asks him and he just says “these are my people” as if he didn’t spend years essentially terrorizing them and working for their oppressors with no qualms about it. We are just expected to go along for the ride, one with no clear goal or end. And nothing even comes out of it in the end. Boba wins and… that’s it. He just gains control after the worlds longest and worst shootout 

Boba Fett, as written, is just a terrible character. No motivation, no drive, zero sense of urgency, zero understanding of the world, a massive fucking pushover, and just an old man. There was a total of 0 moments in this show that made me like him, sympathize with him, or even just find him cool/entertaining. Honestly Fenec carried the show as her character is the only interesting one, but even then she’s entirely flat with zero depth to her, she just happens to be badass and far more likable than Boba.

This doesn’t even mention that terrible use of fan service. Cade Bane just coming out just to shot two people and say some words before being killed? Like what’s even the point of his character. He contributed absolutely *nothing*. Literally any character could have been there. What a fucking waste and it shows that the writers and Disney care more about appealing to the stans then create real art or at least telling a decent story.

At least the music was good though.

16675,103,2,"train",1,"/r/lotr","There's a difference between a story with internal in-world politics and a story where external real world politics are being injected. The former is totally normal and expected. The latter, especially when the external politics/morals are being injected during a later adaptation of the story, often produces bad narrative because it inevitably tries to make the original story into something it's not.

You're right, lots of fantasy and scifi do use political ideas from the time in which the story was created. But that means the story comes into existence based on *only that* irl sociopolitical time period. Those politics, and only *those* politics, are what form the story. If that story was told a century ago and someone today adapted it by injecting today's politics, it would most likely tarnish the story by trying to make it something it's not. It almost always makes for bad narrative.

But that's a bit beside the point. Tolkien *explicitly* said his works were not meant as a parallel for even his day's politics. He *explicitly* said his works were a form of necessary, important escapism. (He had entire essays on the importance of escapism, if I remember right. It's a big deal to his entire narrative outlook.) At no point in time, either today, 20 years ago, or 20 years from now, or even a hundred years from now, should a Tolkien adaptation ever try to inject its irl political setting into the story. Not only is it almost guaranteed to twist the story into something of lesser quality by forcing it to be something it's not, it's a direct repudiation of Tolkien's own narrative ethos. 

For the record, while I have concerns about the show, I am still looking forward to it and hope it's good.","theres a difference between a story with internal inworld politics and a story where external real world politics are being injected the former is totally normal and expected the latter especially when the external politicsmorals are being injected during a later adaptation of the story often produces bad narrative because it inevitably tries to make the original story into something its not

There is going to be changes, some we may personally feel wasn't necessary and some we may actually find ourselves taking a liking to its change. It just depends on how it's handled, both in its quality of the show and it's writing. We'll have to see how it holds up. It was the same with Jacksons LoTR, and some of it did not hold up well with some of its fans. But it's all subjective.

I also feel like it would've been a more popular choice with audiences as well. I mean, I don't think a lot of people noticed or know, but we've already seen Elrond in the Second age before.

* Grogu coming back to Mando felt so rushed. All of season 2 was about the journey to Luke and the ending goodbye was so satisfying, and we saw Mando deal with that for...like 20 seconds on a trip between planets? Then he gets him back in the middle of a battle that has almost nothing to do with either of them? And for us to not get any reaction from Luke on that decision? Ugh
* Everyone is a caricature in BOBF. Fennec is just a badass bounty hunter, Cad Bane is just a badass bounty hunter, Boba is just a badass tough guy, the bad guys are evil out-of-towners from a western, the rancor is a big scary monster...I don't know of any character developments that happened in this whole season.

I guess he's now going to...stop sitting in the big chair at Boba's palace? 
* The choreography in most of the final battle was so silly (360 spin especially). The fact that the wookie and everyone showed up one after the other from presumably far away locations felt comical. They're all running as a group without splitting up. The droids seem to turn and walk so slowly but somehow keep up with everyone. They're all shooting at the force field as if it's gonna do something. They talk about Boba's ship but he never gets it. Mando and Boba don't fly nearly as often as how useful it would seem to be.  Fennec just disposed of everyone all by herself no problem, there was no tension whatsoever in her side quest. 
* I don't like how Cad Bane had all this gravitas when he walked around as if he's the ultimate bad guy, given that this is the first time a lot of us are really getting to know him. It's one thing to have Vader, who everyone knows, be that way.

Tatooine? Nothing. It's a dirt planet full of crime. Boba Fett being the jolly mayor of one city - not even the most well-known one - isn't exactly changing that.

Boba Fett? I think he's kind of a washed-up loser who only succeeded because a bunch of cool people felt sorry for him and/or owed a favor to other cool people. 

Disney Star Wars? They are extremely capable of having amazing sets full of CW-level effects. Good God, throw a *little* dosh at your TV properties instead of just letting them play pretend around the same two streets in Tatooine.

I agree with the Star Wars Theory review of the show. I think they could've saved episode 5/6 for Mando S3.

Overall, they should've focused more on Boba and Fennec to learn more about them, and build them up more as characters, as crime lords with a bit of a heart.

It doesn't take a mind reader to perceive as such a statement that is clearly written to suggest a certain point of view. I don't know why you insist on pretending otherwise?

I suppose a live action version, if (and I hope they do) they choose to avoid Avatar-level CGI, is constrained by the human form and ability to use high level prostheses and costumes for many cast members. I.e., it would be a big ask to have people in costumes to look like some of the animated style characters, particularly in a TV show with extended screen time and action sequences. They managed it with orcs and Uruk-Hai, for example, but they had relatively limited screen time. 

I believe PJ's choices were largely driven by his underlying distaste for 'OTT magic' so he wanted to keep the films relatively grounded. I would imagine Amazon is taking a similar approach and wants to keep things (obviously only somewhat) in line with the films, in order to suggest connection between the two, at least to the casual viewer. 

I think PJ achieved good differentiation - the elves distinguish themselves from men largely through expression and demeanor, with costume and lighting coming second, I think; Hobbits and dwarves are quite well defined through costume and behaviour. 

&#x200B;

I guess they could or could have gone with something a little more outlandish, but I think the main reason that hasn't happened is loosely connected to part of Tolkein's purpose for LOTR in the first place: to create something that would be a new national myth and legend for the UK. Hence, something similar, but different, to reality works best.","nice of you to tell me what im actually thinking in my own head how long have you had this unique ability it must be a very useful technique for you

&#x200B;

....However, there really seems to be some glaring spots to me. Ignoring the already mentioned best episodes of Boba's series not even having Boba in it, there's more to be addressed.

Starting a little with Mando s2 and definitely on showcase here, something feels very different with the fight choreography and scene pacing. I haven't checked through the credits of each episode to see who works on that especially, but there's a real notable sluggishness and more emphasis on set-piece than movement, tempo and weight, compared to Mandalorian s1. If you don't believe me re-watch how Mando infiltrates the compound to rescue Grogu and where they break out of the ruined building while surrounded by Gideon's forces. Simply masterful to watch, imo.

Cad Bane doesn't seem like he had any motivation for being there other than feeling like Boba got too big for his helmet and he didn't like that, I guess? In a way, I can see it, passing on the Pykes' betrayal of his Tusken tribe just to goad Boba....

Additionally, pacing of some scenes feel like they were a bit rushed to try and cram the set-pieces in to make for big moments with barely a scene of set-up beforehand. No way Boba's Rancor was still in his palace tunnels when the fight breaks out; what, did he fly in the jetpack to the palace to then gallop the Rancor across the desert to get to the city in time? Makes more sense there was a place nearby he hid him, but we don't know.

Last nitpick for now: the betrayers and the local Pyke leader got exactly what was coming to them... only, did Boba just tell Fennec to go end them quick and be done with it? Just kills them (artfully) and runs out, that's it. Why didn't Boba avenge his tribe himself? Even just accompanying Fennec to say some last words. Does he not care as much now? Did Disney feel it'd make him too much of a 'bad guy'? As a \*crime lord\*? Just feels weird.

&#x200B;

TL;DR Love Star Wars and the series, but fights feel slow, scenes feel more like set-pieces than character drama, and many scenes feel rushed to cram them in since they used two episodes to carry on Mando and Grogu's story outside of their own series (as much as I love them to death regardless).

Feel free to tear me apart on anything I'm blatantly wrong about, I just love the show and it almost feels like it's going intentionally toyetic in a weird way.","heres my thoughts theres a lot to love here some more than others and some more for the concept than the execution bobas crew being overwhelmed and outmanuevered then fighting back as the underdog and kicking ass heck yeah mando and boba fighting back to back hell yeah boba riding the rancor against siege droids fuck yeah grogu pacifying an enraged rancor adorable among several more moments through the episode and the show as a whole i really enjoyed it and happy to see passion for star wars

Episode 5 where Mando getting exiled and getting his ship seemed like it was plopped in from a S3 Mandalorian storyboard, but it was well-executed, and actually furthered the plot as whole. I don't think they could dropped Din Djarin into Boba Fett season without it, and frankly it was my FAVORITE episode.

Episode 6 or ""Episode of Grogu"" as I call it, completely unnecessary and I wish it was just in S3 Mando. It was cool to see Luke CGI has advanced even more since we last saw him, but why did that whole bit need to be *here,* why not just in next season of Mando? Also, just having Ahsoka there means we've been robbed of seeing Ahsoka meeting Luke for the first time, and that thought makes me U P S E T. Finally, why oh why did they feel the need to make Grogu come back to Din in episode 7? Because they needed a way to tie Peli into that final battle, Avengers style?? I don't buy it, it felt forced. Especially would've loved to see Din traveling to Mandalore solo to find his destiny, and be met with Grogu later. I digress.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The whole season of Boba Fett I was curiously enjoying the little tusken tribe flashbacks, but then flash back to present and Boba is just... a good... guy? Since when? Young Boba in CW had a sense of honor, sure, but this dude still was a bad mamba-jamba. *That's literally the point.* He's supposed to be FEARED, intimidating, DANGEROUS. He's supposed to be like version of Cad Bane with a better sense of honor (due to his mandalorian heritage and upbringing). 

So times like: the mayor's assistant giving him lip, and then the second time being a smartass about the ""mayor's schedule,"" real Boba would've fried that little cretin right then and there. We got a glimpse of the real Boba in Mando S2 vs the stormtroopers - that was awesome, the badass with the body language displaying martial confidence beyond what any of our other characters display, coupled with insanely powerful little gadgets and weaponry. (Also LOL @ Fennec and Boba breaking into the palace and him saying ""there's an advantage to people thinking you're dead,"" immediately grabs little rabbit-droid ""DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM, IM BOBA FETT!""

There's a dichotomy between Din and Boba that I enjoy, but I wish they'd lean into way more; Din is the hero, a hunter with a heart of gold, Boba is the anti-hero, near-villain hunter whose only inhibition is a strange code of honor.

But instead we got... Din and Din-lite, as Boba wants to... clean up the town? He claimed he wanted to be a crime lord, but then just straight up wants to kick out the spice trade, without trying to find a way to be a part of it? He seemed like he wanted to be Cobb Vanth on a bigger scale if you ask me. [Since you didn't ask me, the ending + mid credit scene indicates to me Boba will help Din with Mandalorian problems and find his ""tribe,"" and a recovered/cyborg'd Cobb Vanth will act as a Sheriff-like Daimyo - that's all my guess at least].
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Cad Bane... man so many complaints about Cad Bane. I agree, they could've made him look more like he should from Clone Wars/Bad Batch, and maybe edited his voice to have that smooth robotic backdrop instead of just being low and growly. But I can live with how they handled the conversion to live action - it just could've been better.

Idk i felt pretty disappointed with their final showdown though. All the buildup, for YEARS, of their inevitable cowboy throwdown, and it lead to that? The standoff with Cobb Vanth+Deputy was handled better IMO. Bane is a SW version of The Man in Black (westworld), The Bad (Good, Bad, the Ugly), he's straight up a space cowboy. So you gotta cinematically almost make a tribute standoff like in classic Spaghetti Western films! Tension, that's the word I've been looking for. That standoff needed tension, which we got with Bane vs Vanth.

I like that they tried to have a dialogue between the two, and give some background to casual audience who don't really know Bane that well, but it sort of felt *empty* to me. Might just be me being real picky. They didn't even mention ""last time we did this"" or something to reference the unproduced episode of CW that has all but been confirmed canon. Ugh. I just craved more, and would've been a perfect time to build that much desired tension.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Finally, the cherry on top, Fennec Shand. Fenn-exposition was already pointed out on this thread, and boy there's no better way to put it. How come Boba is the crime boss but Fennec is smarter, deadlier, more strategic, and way more tactful? Who is the real boss here, and why isn't it Fennec? It's like her only purpose in the season has been to explain things and then deus ex assassinate/capture some people for Boba because frankly she's been shown to be better than he is. The worst part of all though is how wasted of an opportunity she is, ANY development for her character would've been received with arms wide open, but instead she's just kinda *there.* It's doubly a shame because Ming-Na Wen does suuuuch a good job. It just feels like Kylo Ren all over again: interesting character, AMAZING actor, TERRIBLE writing and corner-cutting plot points, minimal development.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It's just annoying to me that the best episode was basically the S3 premier of Mandalorian - Din Djarin being exiled and learning more about the Darksaber is the strongest intrigue and cool-factor they've got going right now and man did it show. 

[Also a sidenote: I wonder how the N1 starfighter got to Tatooine? I'm guessing we'll find out in Kenobi, because surely he fights Vader, where he'll learn ""He's more machine now than man. Twisted and evil,"" and there's no way Vader fights him on Tatooine because then he'd surely find out about Luke (also Vader wouldn't set foot on that coarse, rough, irritating planet lol). Maybe we'll see them clash on Naboo?]

So overall I gotta give this season of Boba a 5/10, and most of that is carried by Din Djarin and Fenn-exposition. It's weird, I just don't care to know more about Boba's story after this, frankly I am just invested in Din Djarin and the Darksaber now.

I know that it’s for all the fans that go “awwww” every time he comes on screen, I’m just not one of those but that’s a personal problem. For example I felt like it was so obvious that he was going to stop that one mech (that the mandalorian patiently waited for to shoot the ranco once to start hitting it and then only hitting it twice and one of those times in a part where it seemingly dealt 0 damage for some reason) or that he was going to calm the rancor.

The power ranger characters are both horrible actors. I’m sorry, it’s just the truth. They are stiff, their lines are corny, and they look like they’re from a youtube fan film. I’m sure some of it is out of their control, but the girl is such a horrible actor. I really was excited for her at the least cause I think her look individually is sick, but it’s actually hard to watch IMO. 

I hate when characters spin for no reason, it’s horrible fight scene choreography. 

How did the lady bringing Grogu not hear the blaster fire and explosions as she was pulling up? She just strolls into the scene and is “surprised” by it. 

Why did they go up to the roof? Did they think that the giant droids shield had a softspot like a baby’s head? The only reason it worked was because Boba came in with the Rancor, which they didn’t know was going to happen.

Why does the droid walk at 1mph, but suddenly once Mando is on the cart the droid can run at 50mph?

Why did Grogu destroy the droid pulling them on the cart? It felt to me like the writers needed them to fly off the cart, and just Grogu-ex machina’d it (Maybe I’m missing something?)

Why is everyone running in slow motion, and the droids are comedically missing the entire crowd of people? Why are they running in a straight line through the widest street in Mos Espa? If they walk through any alleyway, the droid can’t get through. 

Why did Boba make a big deal about the droids destroying the city, but then he brings out the Rancor and does even more damage than the droids did?

Does anyone think that the Twi’lek guy is still funny? I’m so sick of his “fish out water, I use my wits to survive” act. Like it was a good bit for him to go out and read the fake surrender treaty, but then he went on for like 15 seconds about stupid bullshit. THEN he had a gun aimed directly at him and I was SO excited for him to die, and Boba+Mando save his life. 

There are so many things that just make no sense at all in this episode. It completely took me out of it and was just god awful writing. I’m not one to nitpick plot holes but those droids were like the strongest thing on earth one scene, then Original trilogy storm trooper bad in the next scene.

why does the droid walk at mph but suddenly once mando is on the cart the droid can run at mph

why did grogu destroy the droid pulling them on the cart it felt to me like the writers needed them to fly off the cart and just groguex machinad it maybe im missing something

why is everyone running in slow motion and the droids are comedically missing the entire crowd of people why are they running in a straight line through the widest street in mos espa if they walk through any alleyway the droid cant get through 

why did boba make a big deal about the droids destroying the city but then he brings out the rancor and does even more damage than the droids did

does anyone think that the twilek guy is still funny im so sick of his fish out water i use my wits to survive act like it was a good bit for him to go out and read the fake surrender treaty but then he went on for like  seconds about stupid bullshit then he had a gun aimed directly at him and i was so excited for him to die and bobamando save his life 

there are so many things that just make no sense at all in this episode it completely took me out of it and was just god awful writing im not one to nitpick plot holes but those droids were like the strongest thing on earth one scene then original trilogy storm trooper bad in the next scene 

honestly as a writer this series astonished me it was all over the place completely rewrote legacy characters had a mix of some of the best and worst episodes of television i have seen in my life etc"

9288,201,2,"train",1,"/r/lotr","This video which claims to put to bed myths around Tolkien provides no sources and presents itself as an authority but ends up spreading and creating more myths than it set out to quell. Here is the definitive answer on whether or not Elves have pointed ears or not:

Tolkien doesn’t often dwell on describing the minute physical details of his characters, so it is possible to read The Lord of the Rings and his other writings without noticing that either Elves or Hobbits have pointed ears. However, in a 1938 letter (No. 27, p. 35) to his American publishers Tolkien says Hobbits have “a round, jovial face; \[with\] ears only slightly pointed and ‘elvish.’”

From this it is clear that Elvish ears were more obviously pointed. This was confirmed when The Lost Road was published in 1987. In the Etymologies under the first definition of ‘LAS’, which is the element in lasse meaning ‘leaf’, there is this note: “The Quendian ears were more pointed and leaf-shaped than \[?human\]” (p.368). \[page references: The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, 1981 & 2006; The Lost Road, 2002 UK paperback\]

The actual quote from letter #27, to Houghton Mifflin, describing Hobbits: I picture a fairly human figure, not a kind of 'fairy' rabbit as some of my British reviewers seem to fancy: fattish in the stomach, shortish in the leg. A round, jovial face; ears only slightly pointed and 'elvish'; hair short and curling (brown). - The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, #27

So Elves DO IN FACT HAVE POINTED EARS. There is no question about this.On the point of Dwarven woman having beards here is the canonical evidence and sources:

In the post-LotR Quenta Silmarillion is a section containing ""the words of Pengolod concerning the Naugrim"" (pp. 203+ of The War of the Jewels, US Edition at least). In paragraph 5, we learn that ""no Man nor Elf has ever seen a beardless Dwarf–unless he were shaven in mockery, and would then be more like to die of shame than of many other hurts that to us would seem more deadly. For the Naugrim have beards from the beginning of their lives, male and female alike; nor indeed can their womenkind be discerned by those of other race, be it in feature or in gait or in voice, nor in any wise save this: that they go not to war, and seldom save at direst need issue from their deep bowers and halls.""

In addition to this: Appendix A, where it is said of Dwarf women that They are in voice and appearance, and in garb if they must go on a journey, so like to the dwarf-men that the eyes and ears of other peoples cannot tell them apart. It seems that (male) Dwarves in Middle-earth all have beards: among other evidence, as Bilbo sets out on his adventure in The Hobbit, we read that ""His only comfort was that he couldn't be mistaken for a dwarf, as he had no beard."" Given that, the quote above must imply that Dwarf women were bearded as well.

So again, DWARF WOMAN HAVE BEARDS! This video is not well researched at all! No sources and literally contradicting what is written canonically. You are creating myths, not dispelling them!","this video which claims to put to bed myths around tolkien provides no sources and presents itself as an authority but ends up spreading and creating more myths than it set out to quell here is the definitive answer on whether or not elves have pointed ears or not

2) galadriel is described by Tolkien as having an amazonian nature. She was a great athlete and commander. He also says that at the beginning of the second age she was much more in spirit like a woman in her early 20’s, while at the end of the 3rd age she was more like someone in their 50’s, so it makes sense for her to be shown taking a much more hands on approach to command.

3) Tolkien never says that all elves have long hair. He only describes some Elven characters as having long hair.

4) If it is Gandalf than that is out of keeping with what Tolkien said about the timeline, but if it’s one of the Blue Wizards, then arguably not as in some of Tolkien’s drafts he said they arrived in the 2nd age.

- Rancor, obviously badass.  Much higher intelligence level than anticipated, as he's the first Boba ally to utilize higher ground.  Albiet, with no ranged weapon equipped, but he's got the spirit.  Remember using jetpacks to land in the middle of an open plaza?

- Robot 2 follows the fleeing crowd down a boulevard, can't hit a single one.  I guess there was no need for them to scatter...

- Like, why even have a single pyke trooper?  Just send in the 2 robots from the beginning

- mod gang the worst characters in SW?  Idk, but in the conversation

- 2 gamorians were as usefull as womp rats.  At least loyal, but didnt even take a single dude with them as they plunged.  Tough L

- Imagine having a rancor and it not being Plan A, Plan B, and Plan C...

- Once the shields go down on the 2nd robot, no a single person continues to fire their blasters at it.  Only when the shields are up is that allowed?

- Peli is a top tier character tho, have to give her credit.

episode  was the only good boba ep the  and  were great mando eps with  maybe rivaling rogue one as the high point of live action star wars since the ot

edit okay so no the nd half did not turn it around  some of the live texts i sent my brother

 rancor obviously badass  much higher intelligence level than anticipated as hes the first boba ally to utilize higher ground  albiet with no ranged weapon equipped but hes got the spirit  remember using jetpacks to land in the middle of an open plaza

 robot  follows the fleeing crowd down a boulevard cant hit a single one  i guess there was no need for them to scatter

 like why even have a single pyke trooper  just send in the  robots from the beginning

 mod gang the worst characters in sw  idk but in the conversation

  gamorians were as usefull as womp rats  at least loyal but didnt even take a single dude with them as they plunged  tough l

 imagine having a rancor and it not being plan a plan b and plan c

 once the shields go down on the nd robot no a single person continues to fire their blasters at it  only when the shields are up is that allowed

 peli is a top tier character tho have to give her credit

11962,149,2,"train",0,"/r/StarWars","Overall:

-	This show is hard to assess. Very disappointing start and, as a character, I think Boba only drew into focus in the final ep. This show simultaneously had some of the best content of the Disney era but failed at being what it was billed as. The mid-season pivot saved the show - but also felt like everyone gave up on the elevator pitch as a compelling prospect. Which feels like a shame. 
-	The Mandalorian is an amazing character - I think they’ve created an icon - the extent to which I only realised seeing him carry an ep outside his own show, without Baby Yoda. 
-	Likewise - we are all gonna be living with versions of Grogu for, what, the next 30 years?
-	The Rancor VFX were astonishing - especially given it was all daylight, plain view. Feels like a gamechanger for TV. 
-	Speaking of FX work, Cad Bane is amazing practical make-up and prosthetic work. I don’t think he would have had half the presence as a mocap character, as good as that tech is. The team absolutely knocked it out the park when it came to realising him on screen. 
-	The CG Luke stuff is interesting but dramatically limited. It’s an incredible achievement but I think may damage the character if overused. Hamill’s a good actor and has always been very expressive - the achievement they made here is impressive but it isn’t sustainable to have a Luke that can only operate as an actor at like 5% of Mark’s range. 
-	Windu for season 2 is essential - and would give Temura something dramatic and meaty to sink his teeth into. That’s a real redemption arc - for Boba and Mace both - there for the taking. The visual of a fucked up, ancient Mace Windu - broken and defeated but still capable of kicking ass - is calling to me. 
-	I hope the production value of Kenobi and Andor is more like Book’s second half than the first. Would love to know what happened behind the scenes here as, as much as the writing didn’t help, the first half of this show looked so empty and underbaked.
-	As a director, Rodriguez redeemed himself. This ep I think could have had a tighter pace in the first half but some of the action beats were amazing. I’m guessing this series really struggled with covid protocols early on or something.","overall

10619,134,2,"train",0,"/r/StarWars",">I don't know of any character developments that happened in this whole season. Who grew? Who wanted something and got it? Or didn't get it?

I'm gonna argue that there was some growth, however overall I think this critique is a good one and I basically agree with you. (On this point and most of your other points as well.) The characters are all tropey and what character development exists is way undercooked. Character development should have been given more airtime, but since it wasn't, the show feels emotionally empty outside of the mandalorian characters and the tusken raider plot, which, surprise, was actually given the space to grow and therefore had emotional heft.

But anyway, what little character development there was that all needed more attention in order to be satisfying:

* Fennec going from ""if I do this my debt is paid"" to being Boba's BFF. They give us some shots of both these characters' stoic faces showing some twinges of emotion and vulnerability during the episode showing how they teamed up, but other than that we have no idea why Fennec decided to go from being a badass self-serving bounty hunter to playing Stardew Valley with Boba.
* Boba himself undergoes a profound change, from being, again, the ruthless and self-serving Boba Fett established by lore up until now, to being a benevolent and honorable community leader. I think it's believable on paper that his time with the Tuskens could have changed him that much, but in classic Star Wars fashion, the show does a terrible job of showing how much time passes while he's with them.

There was an attempt.","i dont know of any character developments that happened in this whole season who grew who wanted something and got it or didnt get it

im gonna argue that there was some growth however overall i think this critique is a good one and i basically agree with you on this point and most of your other points as well the characters are all tropey and what character development exists is way undercooked character development should have been given more airtime but since it wasnt the show feels emotionally empty outside of the mandalorian characters and the tusken raider plot which surprise was actually given the space to grow and therefore had emotional heft

but anyway what little character development there was that all needed more attention in order to be satisfying

 fennec going from if i do this my debt is paid to being bobas bff they give us some shots of both these characters stoic faces showing some twinges of emotion and vulnerability during the episode showing how they teamed up but other than that we have no idea why fennec decided to go from being a badass selfserving bounty hunter to playing stardew valley with boba
 boba himself undergoes a profound change from being again the ruthless and selfserving boba fett established by lore up until now to being a benevolent and honorable community leader i think its believable on paper that his time with the tuskens could have changed him that much but in classic star wars fashion the show does a terrible job of showing how much time passes while hes with them it seems like maybe a few weeks at most when its literal years although the growth of his relationship with the sand people and then grief at their slaughter is all well represented i dont think the audience is given enough to really believe or even realize the massive evolution he undergoes during this time

I am one who tries to hold my criticism of Star Wars to a minimum. Being a person who was all of 3 or 4 when the original came out, I’ve grown with this galaxy over the years. So I’ve told myself I’m not going to be critical of a series that is generally for kids. I try to just enjoy them. 

But dear Lord, Rodriguez has just really not done it for me. I got my 12” Boba Fett figure when I was 4. And I loved that toy. And I’ve loved the mystique of this character. I loved the Tusken story. I loved the background building up his change of heart. But all that took place on Tatooine after he took over Jabba’s reign?  I just don’t get any of it? Crime Lord? There could have been a better story there. 

I was hoping Book of Boba Fett could have been a great non-linear story of his time before the Sarlaac pit. An anthology of some of his adventures from his bounty hunting days. Mask on. Lol. Although I do enjoy Morrison. I’d love to see him play Rex or others. 

I can’t imagine how hard these productions are to put together. So many moving parts. My hat’s off to the actors and everyone working on it. But my goodness Rodriguez’s direction and shooting and lighting and angles. It just made it feel slow, clunky, and cheap. These broad daylight shots of the streets with barely anyone on them. Like I said before. This war seemed like 30-40 kids got together and were playing pretend with some awesome Star Wars stuff. 

There were some fun parts here. I really hate sounding like a nay-sayer. I just feel bummed on a whole, especially by the Rodriguez stuff. Give Bryce Dallas Howard more episodes in the future. 

Looking forward to Mando season 3. I loved season two so much more than season one. So maybe there will be some redemption and retooling if there’s a Book of Boba season two. Fingers crossed.

i am one who tries to hold my criticism of star wars to a minimum being a person who was all of  or  when the original came out ive grown with this galaxy over the years so ive told myself im not going to be critical of a series that is generally for kids i try to just enjoy them 

but dear lord rodriguez has just really not done it for me i got my  boba fett figure when i was  and i loved that toy and ive loved the mystique of this character i loved the tusken story i loved the background building up his change of heart but all that took place on tatooine after he took over jabbas reign  i just dont get any of it crime lord there could have been a better story there 

i was hoping book of boba fett could have been a great nonlinear story of his time before the sarlaac pit an anthology of some of his adventures from his bounty hunting days mask on lol although i do enjoy morrison id love to see him play rex or others 

i cant imagine how hard these productions are to put together so many moving parts my hats off to the actors and everyone working on it but my goodness rodriguezs direction and shooting and lighting and angles it just made it feel slow clunky and cheap these broad daylight shots of the streets with barely anyone on them like i said before this war seemed like  kids got together and were playing pretend with some awesome star wars stuff 

there were some fun parts here i really hate sounding like a naysayer i just feel bummed on a whole especially by the rodriguez stuff give bryce dallas howard more episodes in the future 

looking forward to mando season  i loved season two so much more than season one so maybe there will be some redemption and retooling if theres a book of boba season two fingers crossed such a fun universe to play with"

The Lord of the Rings feels like a shard of an immense mythology. It's a beautiful read, transcendental even. But, as you can imagine, it's not written in an easy-to-glide-through style of modern day epic fantasy. 

2) There is an immense reservoir of Tolkien lore available online. Don't be afraid to slow down and look it up when it doesn't make sense. Also, Tolkien's appendices are jaw droppingly helpful to answering your questions. Furthermore, there are scholarly annotated versions of these texts that give some wicked sharp insights to the author's thoughts and intentions. Those would be the #1 place to go, in my mind, if you want a comprehensive read through your first time.

3) Buuuuuut, as a rule, it won't make sense. And lean into the wonderment of confusion. LOTR, as I mentioned, is a smaller piece of a much larger mythological narrative. You shouldn't expect yourself to grasp every piece of history, big or small, on you first time through. 

4) If you want understanding, The Hobbit and LOTR are solid, but you'll want the historical/mythological basis of The Silmarillion. It's invaluable to making connections in LOTR that aren't easily found on the surface. But, you should know, Tolkien wasn't interested in giving us every bit of material knowledge about his story. There are some things we just don't know. The mystery is a part of the beauty of it all.

5) All that said, the most important thing is that you enjoy the ride. Go as fast or slow as you want. Stop and take notes, or just read and re-read until it's burned into your retinas. Read it like holy scripture or a philosophical thesis. However you handle it, you're approach just needs to be yours. This is now YOUR Middle-Earth journey.

Toxic positivity involves dismissing negative emotions and responding to distress with false reassurances rather than empathy. 

It comes from feeling uncomfortable with negative emotions. 

It is often well-intentioned but can cause alienation and a feeling of disconnection.  

Toxic positivity is shallow. It’s a false reassurance. 

According to Tabitha Kirkland, a psychologist and associate teaching professor at the University of Washington’s Department of Psychology, it’s important to recognize that positivity is two different but related things: Our internal emotions and the emotions we project to others.  
“Toxic positivity is a way of responding to your own or someone else’s suffering that comes across as a lack of empathy.

.

>Upon the triumphal arches, the altars, and the coins of Rome, SPQR stood for Senatus Populusque Romanus (the Senate and the Roman people). In antiquity, it was a shorthand means of signifying the entirety of the Roman state by referencing its two component parts: Rome’s Senate and her people. While today the abbreviation is used rather innocuously in most instances, recent reports have shown that a growing number of white supremacist groups have begun to adopt the ancient acronym to symbolize their movement — and use it in a militaristic mode starkly different from the ways in which the Romans actually applied it.

>A July 2018 post on Pharos, a website committed to exposing the modern appropriation of classical texts and imagery by hate groups, addressed the manipulation of SPQR by white nationalist groups in the United States and consulted classical scholars about the history of the phrase. The issue was brought to the site’s attention when debate arose about a SPQR flag flown outside a student rental house in Athens, Ohio late last year. The question was whether a local activist group was justified in labeling the flag as a Nazi symbol. The Pharos site is run by Vassar College classicist Curtis Dozier, who spoke to Hyperallergic about Pharos’s extensive documentation of the use of SPQR: “The examples we documented connected the symbol to European racial and cultural purity, idealization of military power and violence, and admiration of Hitler and Nazi ideology.” But in order to understand the roots of this troubling appropriation of ancient language and iconography — and to distinguish its various uses by groups, some of whom simply wish to admire ancient Rome — we must first look back at the long history of the acronym. A historical examination accentuates the fact that SPQR underwent several visual manipulations throughout antiquity, the late middle ages, and then under the fascist regime of Mussolini, both in literature and visual art.","oh boy white supremacists signaling and appropriation of roman sayings

and then of all things they go and kill cad bane why he is such a great character who has survived through clone wars and rebels just to die at the hand of some overweight dimwitted version of boba fett using a pointy stick this is the same bounty hunter who outmaneuvered jedi knights that was not the ending he deserved

Miles Morales seems to be fine now, but that was not the case at first. Just google articles about it from 2011, not hard to find those time capsules.  


In my world, imagining my younger family members seeing black representation in Lord of the Rings is incredible. The fact that this community scoffs at a black elf because of some lore, while a lot of other lore is ignored bothers me.  


This show is is not 18+, and it is made to include 10-13 year olds. Having one black elf breaking the ""immersion"" of many people here is upsetting. I believe that the message of unity and gathering (I mean it's called The Fellowship of The Ring) is strong and relevant. Tolkien wrote the Hobbit in 1937 for christ's sake. We can't update it a little bit for the global village we now live in? Really? Most people here want to fall on a sword for only white elves?  


If you were to make a world war 2 film about Poland, and only show black actors, there's a problem. Middle-Earth is LITERALLY made up though. This ain't factual history. Liberties can be taken 80 years after fictional books are published.  


I also work in film and advertising, and I often work on very high-profile jobs. Representation is not always done right, but for example, The Dragon Prince does an amazing job of it.  


What is happening in this teaser is NOT The Dragon Prince. But the inclusion of one new character who has pointy ears, and is black should not have this much controversy. Let's not pretend that this isn't just a show based in a completely made up world. I believe adding a character of colour is a genuine move towards progress. If by a miracle this show becomes a hit, in 10 years time, many people will forget this backlash, like they did with Jackson's films, and Miles Morales.  


In my opinion, there should be much more backlash towards Galadriel wearing armour, and the awful CG. Let's not pretend that overwhelmingly in this reddit that is not the case.  


I understand it's not completely canon, but so many other things are breaking and bending and the overwhelming focus on the pigment of one actor as a cool elf is not appropriate. There are million other changes and adaptations going on here. Why is there so much focus on just this one here?  


For Tolkien and Catholicism there are actual papers and discussions. I found a quote regarding Jackson not focusing on the Tolkien's Catholic themes because he wasn't Catholic himself. I'm sure you can google that.

White elves really worth all this? From an adaptation of an 80 year old book in 2022? When there are a million other breaks and bends in the adaptations. People need to move off the topic. Having a black elf should be totally acceptable and does not break any over-arching story or world of Middle-Earth, just a detail, like many others.

I've seen a few people say this, but I'm having trouble attributing it to any source. Aule created them, but of what, I don't believe we have any source. I agree that we don't know near as much about the dwarves, but they really can't be a wide range of colors no matter how you interpret it. Given Tolkien's tendency to describe everything, especially anything out of the ordinary, why assume this? Dwarves reproduce like humans. The seven dwarf kingdoms are descended from the seven fathers of the dwarves, each of whom awoke with their paired wife, aside from Durin who was alone. This wouldn't create a lot of variety. Only about a third of dwarves are female, which would further limit variety.

The mythology of England was destroyed by all of them- but he liked the Saxons and seemed to adopt their mythology as the English one.

The world of the early Middle Ages was far less multicultural than now- especially outside the Mediterranean but even there we probably wouldn’t consider them diverse in the modern sense.

So it only makes sense to populate Tolkiens world with the people who make sense as the mythological forebears of the English. Turning Tolkiens world into a mirror of our own goes against everything he was trying to do.

Even if we took Tolkien and his intentions out of it- a medieval world would be pretty damn homogeneous. It didn’t and wouldn’t look like our post-colonial globalized world.

It would be like if they made a show about Shaka and the Zulu’s- would you be okay with it if half the Zulu tribe were white or Asian? I certainly wouldn’t. It would make no sense, not to mention it would be co-opting others stories for the sake of contemporary sensibilities.

Probably.The report specified it was a major character, as I recall. The only other possibilities I can think of are Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn (too handsome - ha!) or Weaving as Elrond (too rough around the edges). 

Odds are it's Frodo though. I think Wood is a great actor and does a good job, but he was **so** young (18 when filming began). The Frodo of the book is significantly tougher, more insightful and physically courageous. I'm sure Wood could have played it with more gravitas - you see glimpses of book-Frodo at various points, e.g. the confrontation with Boromir on Amon Hen - but the script plays up the character's youthfulness too. The end result is very different from the Frodo of the book and when the main character has been tweaked that much it really distorts aspects of the story.","was it wood as frodo

Strictly speaking, the only things that are ""canon"" are those which were published by Tolkien: *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings*. 

After his death, his son Christopher pulled together various drafts, and edited them together into one coherent narrative (including writing some bits himself). This was *The Silmarillion*. Many people view that as the ""canon"" version - but really there's not much reason to view the drafts that Christopher chose as any more ""canon"" than the ones he didn't. It was a complicated process to pull it together into one story - so he couldn't always take the latest version that Tolkien had written, because sometimes it wouldn't be compatible with other bits of story which he only had early drafts for (The Fall of Goldolin, for example, is based on a very early draft).

If you want to try and established a hierarchy, it would be:

*The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings* > Other writings by Tolkien > Third party fan-fiction (which includes the movies, games, etc).

You can't produce a single authoritative version of Middle Earth. But then you can't do that for real-life myths either. Just look at the Bible and Christian teachings, and how many different versions and contradictions and translations there have been.","canon is a tricky subject in tolkien

2308,149,2,"train",0,"/r/StarWars","I think it was definitely longer than a few weeks, and I don’t think it was all for nothing either. Grogu got to get back in touch with the force which is something Din couldn’t help him with. Luke was helping him remember, he even said as much. The problem though is Luke can’t really relate to him. Luke grew up with stern but loving parental figures in a stable environment. As far as we know he didn’t really get exposed to how horrible things could get until he saw his aunt and uncles bodies as an adult. Grogu and Din have a lot in common. Both are foundlings that experienced seeing their primary care takes (Din’s parents, Grogu’s Jedi teachers) murdered right in front of them and lost their childhood homes. Both were expected to follow a code, Grogu with the Jedi way and Din with the Mandalorian Deathwatch creed. Now as of this past season of the Mandalorian S2 and book of Boba Fett, now they are both exiled because they can no longer live up to expectations… because of their relationship to one another. That said, both are made better because of the other. Din moves beyond being a cold blooded killer like he was before (referenced a bit in the jail break episode), and Grogu is opening up and finally gets to be a kid after decades of being on the run and trying to hide who he really is. 

They couldn’t have learned what was really important to them if this separation didn’t happen, and they wouldn’t have had a chance to grow while apart which they both did. Grogu leveled up, and I think Din is slowly realizing that he can no longer be satisfied with his old way of life even though he wants to cling to the familiar. Without Grogu he doesn’t have anything else except “the Job”.

I think there was some Disney execs that meddled with Boba Fett, and because they wanted the moneymakers in this show (Luke and Grogu) I get the impression that some things meant for S3 got rearranged to be the two episodes prior. I’m totally spitballing but I feel like the flashbacks to when Boba was a kid was gonna set up something that didn’t really get addressed, like how Boba began his path as a bounty hunter. Pure speculation, but it would account to some of the disjointed episodes.  All that said, I don’t think the time apart was cheapened, we always knew they’d get the band back togheter. Personally I have found it’s best to not judge media until it’s over, and since the Mandoverse extends over several shows I think it’s best to see it all as an arc, vs seeing the shows as stand alones.","i think it was definitely longer than a few weeks and i dont think it was all for nothing either grogu got to get back in touch with the force which is something din couldnt help him with luke was helping him remember he even said as much the problem though is luke cant really relate to him luke grew up with stern but loving parental figures in a stable environment as far as we know he didnt really get exposed to how horrible things could get until he saw his aunt and uncles bodies as an adult grogu and din have a lot in common both are foundlings that experienced seeing their primary care takes dins parents grogus jedi teachers murdered right in front of them and lost their childhood homes both were expected to follow a code grogu with the jedi way and din with the mandalorian deathwatch creed now as of this past season of the mandalorian s and book of boba fett now they are both exiled because they can no longer live up to expectations because of their relationship to one another that said both are made better because of the other din moves beyond being a cold blooded killer like he was before referenced a bit in the jail break episode and grogu is opening up and finally gets to be a kid after decades of being on the run and trying to hide who he really is

we need to reject the outdated monochromatic films we need to embrace everything new sight unseen major corporations get a bad rap but they are uplifting the art of cinema from its barbaric monochromatic ways

as far as amazon rings of power i hope they remain in k hd color schemes and expand to have its own expanded universe perhaps someday morgoth or sauron will open up a portal and then there is a crossover event where amazons kinda sorta lotr fights tolkiens lotr and also the xmen"

But then the studio came in told them to make it 3 movies that were about 3 hours long just like the LotR trilogy. So they had to go back and add in a ton of shit and that's basically how Desolation of Smaug came about. I think some of the extra stuff ended up in UJ and BotFA, but it was mostly all DoS to be able to stretch to the 3 movies.

Also, iirc they screwed over Evangeline Lilly, too. Supposedly, she would only sign on to do the movie if her character wasn't put in a love triangle. She didn't want to do anything like that again after Lost and possibly be type-cast as the chick always caught in a love triangle with two other dudes. They agreed they wouldn't do that, she signed on, they started filming and everything was fine.

And then the studio came in. 

They wanted a love triangle between the new, hot female elf, the hot elf guy that everyone remembers from before and who gained a crazy amount of popularity from that same role, and the new, hot, young dwarf guy that was sure to be the next Orlando Bloom/Legolas of the Hobbit trilogy (ok, those descriptions were my own, obvs, but after hearing that, that's what I can only imagine the studio was thinking when they told them to do that).

I wish I could remember where I read about all this. Again it was several years ago now, and it's all just memory now, but I think about it every time I watch the Hobbit trilogy.

The only thing I hope is that - if future shows would be made - it doesn't become the norm. Mortals marrying immortals is interesting for sure, but I feel they should treat it like something special.

It would also change the feeling of Middle-Earth as vast world with not many people, where many folks live quite isolated from each other.

And Elves and Men live seperately for even more reasons, which is directly related to death. After all, Elves want to preserve the world, and death makes that pretty hard to do. Meanwhile, many Men are jealous of Elven immortality. This has caused a rift between both.

So they should focus first and foremost on the difference between these races, before they can really delve into the marvel that is the unity of a Man and an Elf. It should be something special.

Peter Jackson was brought on last second to replace del Toro, who did a good job, but had a different idea then the Studio wanted it, which is a good thing mostly, since del Toro is awesome for his own stories but not the best at adapting stuff. So Jackson was extremely rushed and the studio always changed their mind on things, like Tauriel and Legolas, who were at first planned as a cameo, then expanded into a sode character and then weirdly shoehorned in and then they wanted a love story, although the actress for Tauriel explicitly didn't want that. 


Now, that explains alot, but Jackson also has some fault, since he wanted a trilogy instead of only one or two movies, to tell the story. They granted him two, but since he would have needed to cut the second one down alot to make it a complete story, he asked to get a third which he didn't have enough material for to make it a whole movie - which led to all the pointless shit. 


In the end it was unfortunate, I personally like those movies as what they are supposed to be - LotR prequels, rather than a true to the book adaptation - but I certainly do see the problems and mistakes and some are very glaring, while others can be easily overlooked.","two problems were the main reasons  studio interference and a rushed schedule peter jackson was brought on last second to replace del toro who did a good job but had a different idea then the studio wanted it which is a good thing mostly since del toro is awesome for his own stories but not the best at adapting stuff so jackson was extremely rushed and the studio always changed their mind on things like tauriel and legolas who were at first planned as a cameo then expanded into a sode character and then weirdly shoehorned in and then they wanted a love story although the actress for tauriel explicitly didnt want that

When people with mail are struck by arrows, while the arrows may not pierce enough that it kills them, the blunt force transferred by the impact of the arrow sticking is still potentially deadly. The arrows aren't really being deflected off.

>And when he \[Benkin\] was aiming at the besiegers, his drawing on the bow was identified by everyone because he would either cause grave injury to the unarmed or put to flight those who were armed, whom his shots stupefied and stunned, even if they did not wound. \[76\]

Crouched lances on horseback striking mail also will usually kill the wearer by coming at them hard and fast. Swords don't get deflected either, they'll strike the mail but not penetrate or break the links & instead transfer blunt force.

>Such weapons of percussion were especially effective against mail armour; repeated blows could shatter bones and kill the victim without even breaking a single riveted link of his hauberk. In this situation the flexibility of mail, an advantage in other respects, was a positive disadvantage."" \[94\]

Credit above to myarmour for their excellent articles on the topic compiling many sources.

Mail is usually defeated by some form of blunt damage, you could strike harder and heavier to transfer force or quicker with more attacks. It does not function like an energy shield does.

People didn't really attack slowly with swords, they had to be fast and precise. You may use half swording against mail as depicted in some treatises if you do use a sword. [Here's a video of someone using half swording to show you how fast you may be striking someone](https://youtu.be/2bdMfaymGlk).

If you are thinking of deflection, you may be thinking of [later sloped plate armour](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/f1/5a/7a/f15a7ae2d28ccd14f38993f7ebb0acd7--landsknecht-armures.jpg). These could prevent projectiles that strike deflecting into areas you don't want them to go. [Here is an example of this happening on a breastplate](https://youtu.be/DBxdTkddHaE?t=1193). You can see a cool bit of protection for preventing arrows that strike from snapping upwards into the neck.

such weapons of percussion were especially effective against mail armour repeated blows could shatter bones and kill the victim without even breaking a single riveted link of his hauberk in this situation the flexibility of mail an advantage in other respects was a positive disadvantage

mail is usually defeated by some form of blunt damage you could strike harder and heavier to transfer force or quicker with more attacks it does not function like an energy shield does

people didnt really attack slowly with swords they had to be fast and precise you may use half swording against mail as depicted in some treatises if you do use a sword heres a video of someone using half swording to show you how fast you may be striking someoneif you are thinking of deflection you may be thinking of later sloped plate armourthese could prevent projectiles that strike deflecting into areas you dont want them to go here is an exle of this happening on a breastplateyou can see a cool bit of protection for preventing arrows that strike from snapping upwards into the neck

16818,143,2,"train",1,"/r/lotr","I do actually. In my travels I've seen Jesus portrayed as black, Asian, Hispanic, and white, and all are incorrect. Jesus was Hebrew. However, I think most people's concerns with the issue regarding multiple ethnicities suddenly appearing in Middle-Earth is that Tolkien wrote the Lord of the Rings to be like ancient mythology for England and/or Northern Europe, as in, back before travel was common and when commonfolk often spent their entire lives within a 40 mile radius or less. England and Northern Europe is located quite north in the world, which is why humans there evolved to be pale-skinned, so they could absorb more sunlight. It makes no sense for remote villages located in a place like this to be so ethnically diverse when some modern cities aren't even that diverse. It makes no sense for people in this place to not be pale-skinned, given it's location and intended historical mythology. Such considerations should apply to the production of any movie or TV show. The cast of the movie Gods of Egypt should have consisted of Middle Eastern actors/actresses, but it was white-washed, which doesn't make any sense because I don't think the Egyptians viewed their gods as white people. Mulan and Raya would have been super weird and inaccurate movies if the characters had been animated as anything other than Asian. Although the Pirates of the Caribbean movies did include some diversity, they probably could have included more since by the early 1700s many ethnicities and nationalities traveled to the Caribbean if they didn't already live there. Game of Thrones handled ethnicity quite well in that people from the North were portrayed as pale-skinned and people from southern places such as Dorne and cities in mid to southern Essos were portrayed as dark-skinned. I'm just saying, I appreciate accuracy and I understand people who do. Not to mention, such racial diversity which is portrayed in this new series is not portrayed in the Lord of the Rings, which would imply there was a freaking mass genocide or such.","i do actually in my travels ive seen jesus portrayed as black asian hispanic and white and all are incorrect jesus was hebrew however i think most peoples concerns with the issue regarding multiple ethnicities suddenly appearing in middleearth is that tolkien wrote the lord of the rings to be like ancient mythology for england andor northern europe as in back before travel was common and when commonfolk often spent their entire lives within a  mile radius or less england and northern europe is located quite north in the world which is why humans there evolved to be paleskinned so they could absorb more sunlight it makes no sense for remote villages located in a place like this to be so ethnically diverse when some modern cities arent even that diverse it makes no sense for people in this place to not be paleskinned given its location and intended historical mythology such considerations should apply to the production of any movie or tv show the cast of the movie gods of egypt should have consisted of middle eastern actorsactresses but it was whitewashed which doesnt make any sense because i dont think the egyptians viewed their gods as white people mulan and raya would have been super weird and inaccurate movies if the characters had been animated as anything other than asian although the pirates of the caribbean movies did include some diversity they probably could have included more since by the early s many ethnicities and nationalities traveled to the caribbean if they didnt already live there game of thrones handled ethnicity quite well in that people from the north were portrayed as paleskinned and people from southern places such as dorne and cities in mid to southern essos were portrayed as darkskinned im just saying i appreciate accuracy and i understand people who do not to mention such racial diversity which is portrayed in this new series is not portrayed in the lord of the rings which would imply there was a freaking mass genocide or such"

> When you're in the majority it doesn't matter much

Accuracy always matters. Saying it only matters if you're African, Asian, native to someplace, or something else is kinda racist. Saying this work is objectively better simply because we changed the color of this character's skin also is. It doesn't matter which way it goes, because placing a difference in inherent value based on skin color is pretty clear cut racism. Besides, when did I say I was in the majority?

I feel sorry for you that you didn't feel represented. But what I find more sad that you were taught that skin color matters so much you can't identify with a character who doesn't match you in that way. Major movie roles have been ethnically diverse for decades now, so I don't get why you'd want to force it on a specific setting. A color change in a historical European setting, where it shouldn't exist, is not the solution anyway. Instead, exploring settings where other ethnicities would exist or even be commonplace would satisfy everyone. These settings even exist in Middle Earth. 

Rewriting history is wrong. Purposely casting Anne Boleyn as black is every bit as racist as purposely casting Mohammad or an African tribal chief as some blond, blue eyed, white guy.","yes whitewashing is a problem in fact purposely whitewashing is the exact same problem particularly now that the acting community is so large and diverse that any type of role can be filled with a decent actor who looks fairly close to how they should which is what should be happening theres also a difference between just picking the best actor for the job ignoring ethnicity and purposely changing ethnic roles

The positioning of Snoke in Palpatine’s role led me and many others to speculate whether Palpatine’s spirit would return in some form as possessing Snoke or using him as a puppet - the foundation was very poorly laid but there were breadcrumbs that fueled speculation at least. At minimum his inclusion without explanation and the cinematic similarities between his and Palpatine’s scenes in Empire at least didn’t preclude the possibility.

When Ruin cut Snoke in half with no reference of any sort to Palpatine’s influence behind the scenes, the series became entirely lost in the water. That’s an example of a man who doesn’t play well with others, a narcissist really, if benign and kind and compassionate- still someone who visualizes himself/his ideas entirely at the exclusion of others. 

Ruin got what he deserved when Jar Jar returned and cockblocked Ruin’s cockblock and produced a shitty final chapter that just imploded upon itself as the house of cards Jar Jar had ultimately built originally (Ruin just weakened its structural integrity - pretty badly to be fair-  but Jar Jar laid the foundations for failure with his shortsighted and safe choices in TFA), fully collapsed into a million fragmented pieces, like a Big Kid stepping on a little kid’s gargantuan illogical and entirely structurally unsound lego set.

I loved TROS if only because it made both Ruin and Jar Jar look bad, made Disney look like fools, and made the PT (and Lucas) look like Shakespeare.

“Filming for The Book of Boba Fett began in late November 2020, right in the middle of the pandemic, which played to Rodriguez’s strengths as an indie filmmaker accustomed to plowing forward and improvising amid uncertain conditions. “I came out of the gate firing away — ‘Let’s shoot, shoot, shoot because we might not be here next week, we might get shut down,'” he says.”

But Middle-Earth is fictional. To say that it’s “based upon medieval Europe” when it includes places like Mordor and Lothlorien, includes creatures like the balrog, includes rings of power and wizards and hobbits and orcs … surely none of THAT stuff was in medieval Europe, yes? So, it seems that Middle-Earth is already not COMPLETELY accurate to medieval Europe. 

What I don’t understand (and what I’d like for you to address) is this: if someone is a proponent of accuracy to medieval Europe, why would they be okay with the existence of fucking Balrogs, but not okay with the existence of black dwarves? Why is it that it’s okay for Tolkien to base SOME stuff upon medieval Europe, while pulling other stuff straight from his imagination or general fantasy lore, but when it comes to the Amazon show, it has to be PRECISELY accurate to medieval Europe?

(assuming that there were zero people of color in medieval Europe, which I doubt tbh, but sure, let’s go with that)

It’s not so much that I’m “lost in my argument.” It’s that your argument isn’t that convincing.

Give me one good reason why Boba wouldn’t check to make sure he’s really dead in this case. It’s not because he ran off right away, we watched him linger there. I don’t buy that Bane is capable of hiding his aliveness from arguably the greatest bounty hunter in the galaxy, all while not expecting Boba to stab him with the staff. 

The other characters coming back were questionable, but Fennec was at least intended by the writers to come back. Maul had no business, but his death wasn’t as important to the story as Bane’s would be to wrapping up Boba’s story. 

Palpatine didn’t technically survive his, that was a clone, still stupid though.

We were specifically shown Anakin surviving, that scene was literally meant to show that Obi Wan did t finish the job. 

Boba wasn’t even killed on purpose, he was just in the way. 

The Anakin is the only one kind of relevant, since he was at Obi Wan’s mercy. The writers were in a bind there though, since somehow they had to have Obi Wan maim the shit out of him but not kill him.

If they wanted to bring back Cad Bane, there’s no reason they would have used a scene that requires such a suspension of disbelief on Boba’s part. Have Boba shoot him, then all hell breaks loose, and show that he crawled away after if you want him to stay alive? Why would they make a point of showing Boba has him at his complete mercy, just for him to somehow become an idiot that doesn’t check to make sure he’s really killed someone.

The only way it works is for some reason Boba wants to keep him alive, or they show a flashback of someone immediately chasing Boba away from the body. I’m not saying he’s fully dead on screen, but he’s as good as with all the information we have.

Plus narratively, it just makes sense for his story to end at the conclusion of Boba’s show. Their rivalry was literally built up for this purpose. No reason to cheapen their final fight, when you can just use all the space in between clone wars and that fight to show him more in live action.","i keep saying it because none of those involved the persons body actively sitting in front of the person who killed them give me one good reason why boba wouldnt check to make sure hes really dead in this case its not because he ran off right away we watched him linger there i dont buy that bane is capable of hiding his aliveness from arguably the greatest bounty hunter in the galaxy all while not expecting boba to stab him with the staff

This hasn't ever been true. Half the time scenes from trailers aren't even in the final movie/show. Trailers are put together by a separate team following a trailer template. There are scenes that are cut together that aren't even the same shot, they just can't show some things yet so they need to fill a split second longer so it doesn't feel awkward (Durin breaking the stone has a super fast cut to a different rock breaking scene - purpose is likely because we aren't supposed to see what is inside the rock Durin is breaking).

These scenes were likely quickly scrambled together with a rushed editing job done over which makes it look sub par to some people (people are too picky IMO - you could make a Minecraft movie better than some of the best looking movies these days). Also most scenes in this look better than WoT - would love an actual breakdown shot-by-shot that goes into more detail. Every comment I've seen has just been ""I don't know, it just doesn't *feel* like Lord of the Rings"" which is because (spoilers) everyone associates a ""LOTR feel"" with the PJ movies and not the actual vision of Tolkien (which is FINE, just not a good argument against this show).","this are the trailer scenes this means they are handpicked because they were the best representation of the show and the best looking ones

Middle-Earth was ""real"" to Tolkien.

Middle-Earth was ""real"" to Peter Jackson, and he (correctly, IMO) chose to present the world to his audience as if it was real.  He wanted the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy to look like it was a documentary shot in Middle-Earth.

More accurately, but still oversimplifying, Shakespear was educated in Greek tragedies and wrote his tragedies following the Greek structure while trying to elevate them by exploring chapters more deeply before their death.

Tolkien elevated this structure further still by exploring Boromir in the Greek style before his death and in th3 Shakespearian style after his death. That rabbit hole goes *deep.* 

The Jackson trilogy did an excellent job presenting Boromir as Gondor's shield (after his death, nice) and having him die due to a lack of his own shield (shown left behind before his death). It even goes so far as the shape of the blade of his sword being wider than most (possibly from Tolkiens work?), a defensive design choice that makes the blade harder to break when blocking blows (in the book it *did* break and I'm not sure why the movie changed that).

I mean seriously, this answer doesn't make sense at all. If you ask a yes/no question and one of the answer possibilities is bullshit, then your question is not a question but a statement.

Why put your statements like that? I know you're not the only one and maybe you even couldn't answer that because you just do what many do... Those Is-it-just-me-or statements .. isn't this just some method to call people that think the same way you do?

If you put your statement in a way like: I think we deserve a better Boba Fett show. Then this is open for debate. One can agree or disagree, both possibilities are adequate (from a perspective of how language works. Here the point is: what possibilities to react does the form of a statement allow).

If you say: is it just me or do we deserve... Then the generic answer is agreement (in the form of a disagreement, that's ironic haha). The only logic answer is: no it is not just you, we are a group and we all agree. (Logic based on what the form of your statement allows for possibilities to reply).

I disagree, you don't deserve a better Boba Fett show. Ha! But the form of your statement does not give me the possibility to express that as a fitting reply. 


So this Is-it-just-me-or way of stating something closes the topic. It's a call for agreement, that then is given in the form of disagreement. That's interesting because this way you take away the possibility to really disagree. The disagreement option is already occupied by agreeing to you haha. That's a really smart mechanism.
As I said. Disagreeing to you (in a form that replies to your statement fittingly) would need me to state no, it's just you. And that is obviously not the case. Whatever you state after Is-it-just-me-or you will find people who agree with high probability. I see those kind of posts a lot and it is never followed by an unusual or really individual statement. 
People who are disagreeing are forced to (sorry, not by you personally, but by the logical form of your statement and the lack of options to disagree) break the flow of conversation (I am sorry, I cannot find a better way to put that). You have to reply in an inadequate way... Ok never mind, I think I made my point.

2. Slave I is an iconic spaceship that can never have enough screentime, and as you said, no armor rancor is kinda dumb, but Boba is supposed to be smart. If they wanted the Rancor, Boba shoulda rode it into Mos Espa to begin with as a show of force. How much time did he waste riding a rancor back to town instead of just bringing in Slave I? How many extra people died because he wanted a more epic fight?

3. Firespray class gunships - as told - are fighters and I guess they don't really care, if they can eat what they are fighting (I mean it literally blew away all the nikto bikers and sand worms instead of eating them all).

4. And this is kinda the best reason, if you disagree with the rest. Boba could not jave possibly known two droids were the last thing the pikes had. All episode Boba gets surprised. Boba thinks he he has a pact with rival lords? SURPRISE! Boba thinks he can't be flanked? Ohh yeah there's a surprise. Boba thinks the pikes numbers are smaller then they turn out to be? Surprise again! Boba thinks freetown isn't coming? Ha! SURPRISE! Boba thinks they rannoff the pikes, onlu to find out they have walking tank droids with super shields? Yeah... surprise... boba thinks fire will work! Fire no work. Surprised. Boba thinks bring rancor to fight is a good idea, and everyone will appreciate it. Surprise! Villagers try to kill rampaging monster because it is a wild animal just wreaking havok. Tries to eat mando because it has no chill. Bad form Boba.

Exactly when did Boba show off his amazing tactical abilities? Pikes have access to ships, which is half the reason he had piggies at the spaceport, who died thanks to Boba's martial prowess. What if the droids weren't the last wave? What if next the pikes just firebombed the whole city from the air? You know what woulda been helpful against both droids and ships? 

Was the rancor cool? Sure. Should it have been part of the finale? Absolutely. Chekov's rancor. But should Boba have flown off mid fight, with no announced plan, just to show up on a rancor instead of in a gunship? Fuck no. 
 
The best tool a rancor has is the fact it is a bonafide monster. If Boba had planned for the rancor to be used early on againat squishy scared meatmen, then yeah, good plan. And rancor could still fight some droids. Villagers would see rancor maybe not such a bad guy.

13728,217,2,"train",0,"/r/StarWars","The finale got Rodriguezed. What a terrible disappointment. 

Especially after two outstanding episodes. 

Once again, nobody made any sense. The decision to fight in the city didn’t make sense. He was convinced by a biker that he doesn’t know and certainly doesn’t trust that staying in the city to protect the people is the way to go. Which is a silly argument with no merit to begin with, much less to agree with. The syndicate was after Boba and his gang, if they left the city, the people of the city would be safe. Staying is what endangers them. She knew that. And so did Boba. So from that moment on, I am not believing the story. 

Once again fights so bad. 

From running down the middle of the street, and not grabbing shelter (the biker leader says she knows the city yet we never see her use the city to her advantage, not offensively or defensively). To the greatest crazy stupid nonsense I’ve ever seen, nobody fires on the droids when their shields are down. When they first see them, they all watch them come down the street unshielded. Why? Waiting to see whose side they’re on? But the second those shields go up, they never stop firing. Can nobody on this squad learn? It’s insane. Watching Mando try three times with the dark saber made me literally scream. The fuck did he think would happen the third time? Then he says something about if you’re slow enough, you can pass through the shield. But doesn’t try until the very end. And then doesn’t go slow at all. He just jumps through. And once the shields are down, the crew who up until this point never stopped firing at the shields, now they all stop. And not only do they all stop firing, we cut to them several times just watching from behind their wall. To show off just how much they aren’t firing on the unshielded droid. Guh. 

Let’s talk about relative speed, something Rodriguez knows nothing about. We saw a bit of this in the train episode, but here it’s more egregious. We know how fast the droids can move, and we know how fast a speeder can move, yet every time the speeder turns a corner and gets away, they turn around and there’s a droid. Can the droids teleport? Or have burst speed? Or something? If they do, shouldn’t they have shown that? At least once? Even the group running down the street was running faster than the droid, yet they could never quite lose it. 

Cad Bane vs. a rancor? With only a flamethrower? C’mon. And Boba gets knocked into buildings, thrown upside down by a droid while riding a rancor, but when the rancor recoils from fire? That’s when he gets thrown? C’mon. That rancor runs rampant all over town, not afraid of anyone, not even Mando (or his flamethrower. In his mouth!) and it’s afraid of Cad Bane? Why? What am I watching?

I still can’t get over everybody firing at the shields. 

Why was Fennec a ghost/ninja in Mos Eisley. But can’t take out six guys walking in the open in a street in Mos Espa?

Every time a piece of the city gets destroyed I wonder why they weren’t fighting from the cover of Jabba’s palace. How is this fight in their streets helping these people?

I’m not going to talk about Boba and the rancor getting to the fight so fast or Grogu showing up by himself (with R2?) in Luke’s X-Wing or why Dan Dority implied that Vance was dead or how two of Boba’s three gangs somehow survived their ambushes, because all of that could be explained with some convoluted reasoning. But it all pushes credulity.

im not going to talk about boba and the rancor getting to the fight so fast or grogu showing up by himself with r in lukes xwing or why dan dority implied that vance was dead or how two of bobas three gangs somehow survived their ambushes because all of that could be explained with some convoluted reasoning but it all pushes credulity

19125,87,2,"train",1,"/r/lotr","I stand by comment. There are two ways to approach *LotR*; as a simple fantasy adventure where a little guy tries to destroy a magic Ring and there are lots of neat battles!

or

It's a story of an entire, weary world becoming the victim of yet another war in an endless series, and the tale of the land sacrificing its magic to eliminate one great evil.

I choose the latter. Peter Jackson plainly prefers the former. He's a two-dimenisonal guy, all plot. On removing the scouring of the Shire, Jackson said, “At the very beginning of this process, we’d identified the spine of our movies — Frodo taking the Ring to Mordor — which means that the climax of our movies is Frodo destroying the Ring.""

As far as I'm concerned, that is the *plot* of the book, but *not* what it is about. Once you have removed the scouring, once you have given all the hobbits a gleeful return to an untouched Shire (in exchange for a giant, stupid pumpkin), once you have eviscerated any sense of the loss of the elves and the toll taken on Frodo by having the Ring taken from him... at that point, you're no longer telling the same story.

And whilst we all know the OT wasn't planned at all, the extent to which the PT was planned out is overstated. Characters and events underwent significant changes during development in between Episodes (it benefitted of course from having an ending that had already been written in the OT).

13517,150,2,"train",0,"/r/StarWars","I agree with you that this community can be extremely toxic. Example I checked in after Bo Katan got introduced in the mando season 2.  People were talking about Bo saying that the people only watching for baby Yoda wouldn’t understand but people that “were actually watching the show would”.  When that sentiment was heavily upvoted I knew there was a problem.

That said I think it is fine to say that I thought this show was pretty disappointing to me.

1. I actually was fine with the first 2 episodes and thought it was leading to boba using Tuscans as a military force at the end.   They were dropped and it made it feel even more obvious how few people he had on his side.

2. It’s funny to me that the lore behind boba fett is vast and he is a badass. While in the movies he never really did much and got taken out by blind Han.  This show seemed to somehow unintentionally do both it acts like Boba is a real threat and dialogue supports it but his actions are closer the the bumbling parody of the character making fun of his origins.  I would enjoy a hardcore old Clint Eastwood style Boba Fett or a parody mocking the character just don’t try to do both.

3. I think most people agree that the best episodes of the show were the mando ones.  Which would be fine but it makes lack in quality in the other episodes stick out.  It also hurts because otherwise people could just skip this show and it wouldn’t matter but some good mando stuff was put in this show.

4.  I didn’t watch the cartoon I only know of Cad through passing info.  I think the show could have used him early and possibly continued the flash backs with him so people that didn’t know the character had more emotion with him and would have tied to show together better.

5. I enjoy Rodriguez movies but I think it is fair to say his action scenes this season felt off.  Weird timing and character decisions.   The chase scene with the mods sticks out.  It looked like they weren’t moving fast at all and took forever.  The last episode with the decision to just keep clumping up the heroes or not use cover but it never matters.

6. think they gave everything that we liked about Boba to Mando so it was hard to have 2 shows about the same character.   The episode where mando shows up for a bounty and kills everyone in Bobas show is what I think people expected in the show not a crime lord that is really just wanted to be sheriff/mayor.

I think the show was fine but I won’t recommend it to anyone.  I won’t ever come back to it.

Tolkienist here. Let's start and try not to give you a headache and keep it as straightforward as possible without going into too much detail.

1. It must be said clear that the movies are **not** the story. They are an *adaptation* of the original story in the books. PJ's movies while being truly revolutionary and becoming classics, are full of mistakes and inconsistencies and general fanfcition.

This scene is one of those. Sauron doesn't blow up like that. In fact he is brought down by 2 of  the strongest leaders of Men and Elves - the High King of elves Gil-Galad and the King of Men, Elendil. Elrond (Gil-Galad's herald at the time) and Isildur (Elendil's son) are also present but they don't participate in that duel of Sauron vs Elendil/Gil-Galad. Those 2 physically manage to defeat and (seemingly) ""kill"" Sauron. Only **after** he's physically defeated does Isildur come and cut of his fingers and claim the Ring. That big bang that you see in the prequel after Sauron blows up never happened.

2) Pure biology. It's the same as asking why are Elves taller than any other race or why do Men not have immortality. I'm only 99% sure on my answer so any fellow scholar is free to correct me on this one.

3) The screeching is a way PJ tried to show what you cannot see in the books. The mere physical presence of the Nazgul makes you feel afraid and is capable of overpowering you. They also have what is called ""Black Breath of the Nazgul"". Their breath (represented as shrills in the movies) can make you ill, overpower you and fill you with terror and fear (unless you're an Elf or a higher being).

4) It is heavily speculated that yes, the Ringwraiths are afraid of water and fire. At the Ford of Bruinen when they try to cross the river, the summoned flood kills their horses and destroys their clothes and they have to walk thousands of miles back to Mordor for Sauron to give them new clothes.

5) (My most favourire topic, this is where I shine the best).

They do. The wizards are not Harry Potter wizards in Tolkien's world. In fact, there is no such thing as ""magic"" or ""wizardry"" in this universe. It is just what the people call it because they don't understand it. In fact Gandalf and Saruman are holy/divine spirits (read angels) sent by the Valar (read Archangels) to Middle Earth with the mission to help the free people defeat Sauron. They take the form of old wise Men but they are in fact THE most powerful beings in Middle Earth at that time (save Sauron). The wizards are not allowed by the Valar to defeat Sauron by themselves, because that battle would be so terrible, the collateral damage would be too much. They take physical forms which limits their powers a bit, but they are still supernatural beings.

In fact, Gandalf, Saruman, Sauron and the Balrog in Moria they all are of the same ""race"" (read same level of angels). They are basically equals in might and power.

Gandalf's staff is not a magic wand like in Harry Potter. It is a sign of his ""authority"", like a sceptre is for a King. He channels his powers through the staff but he doesn't need it to perform ""magic"". Also, please remember, although Gandalf has some cool scenes, PJ heavily spoiled Gandalf's original image. In the books Gandalf is way more bad ass and courageous. He is considered one of the most important hero in this tale. If your sister hasn't watched the rest of the movies, I won't spoil anything.

6) Movie fancfiction.

7) Movie fanfiction (this scene was heavily changed in the book) but there is one interesting thing. Elves are lighter than Men or Dwarves. For example, remember on the snowy mountain Legolas can walk on the snow normally while the rest of the Fellowship is chest deep in it. That could explain this statement but like I said, this is not how it plays out in the book.

8) They are. There are many reasons why, one of them being that the waters of Middle-Earth, especially this particular river is ""hallowed"".

9) Ooff, that's a long one. To be as short as possible, Tolkien's world is supposed to be our world but tens of thousands of years before. The idea is that Dwarves and Elves ""faded away"" and the world was left to be governed by Men.

10) Let's put it this way - the sunlight (which is also pure and divine in this world) is very unpleasant to the creatures of darkness. They hate it and cannot tolerate it. It wouldn't necessarily ""damage"" them but it does make it difficult for them. This is not represented well in the PJ movies. You will see a lot of scenes with orcs under sunlight, which is wrong as in those scenes in the books the face of the Sun is covered by clouds that Sauron summons.

11) Fanfiction

12) That's Quenya, one of the 2 majestic languages of the Elves.

13) Technically this is wrong as in the books it's not a troll that stabs Frodo but a great chieftain of orcs. But in this particular scene, this is not one of those trolls that turn to stone by daylight perhaps.

Phew that seems to be it. Happy to answer more questions! Take care. :)","enthusiastically rubs hands
