20398,73,5,"test",0,"/r/StarWars","I know what happened because my cat told me.

The reason why The Last Jedi was so disjointed as a movie, and that's not even including the Palpatine involvement, is because James Cameron had the script for all three movie planned out since the beginning. At least a general outline of what he wanted to do.

So once Rian Johnson came in to direct the second movie, it became a massive problem, and all three entities share some of the blame for the second and third movies: James, Rian, and Disney execs that pretend they know how to make a movie. That's not the point, however. The thing is once James was brought in to do the third movie, Disney was only allowing him to make one movie, but he had two movies' worth of material to shove into it.

You can see the divide in the movie once Rey is thought to have killed CHewey. Is he really dead? Will Rey be dark side? What's the knife for? Palpatine was going to be mentioned somewhere in the second movie and then be the main villain in the third, but James not having control over the second movie made so much pre-planning utterly moot.

I understand wanting to rule with respect instead of fear but you're still (supposedly) a crime lord so a bit of brutality and fear never hurts to get your point across. If nothing else, this show showed me that Fennec should be in command. She has restraint when necessary, she knows how to play the field and she's incredibly dangerous as we saw in the last few minutes. And in a show about Boba Fett with two episodes barely featuring him at all, I feel like the show kind of lost its footing with episode 5 when it just became The Mandalorian 2.5. This show can't really stand on its own and it's a problem to me because it almost feels unnecessary. Was nice to see Bane and didn't think he was going to die to be honest.

Breed, as a noun, has three meanings in English:

1. A group of related animals or plants with similar genotypes and phenotypes, usually in the context of domestication where the group is produced and maintained deliberately by selective breeding for those qualities.
2. Any race or lineage of a thing 
3. A group of people with shared characteristics without any sense of genetic relation to one another: eg. 'Honest politicians are a dying breed'. 

Some dictionaries fold two and three into one another nowadays. With eugenics and genaology being rather out of fashion, we don't tend to speak of 'breeds' of people in quite the sense 2. means anymore.

Literally none of these definitions match up to Tolkein's use of the word 'race' where he uses it roughly to mean 'species'. The races of Middle Earth are Men, Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits, Ainur, Orcs, Trolls etc. Not all of these groups match on to the strict definition of species. For instance, elves and men can have fertile children. Nonetheless, the differences between these groups is much bigger than the difference implied by the term 'breed' in typical usage.

38696,104,5,"test",1,"/r/lotr","I see people saying this a lot, that you could choose to explore the East of middle earth, but I think there would have been a greater problem there. A show like this would *never* have been made if it didn’t have a connection to the established lore. Of course it wouldn’t, what would be the pitch there? “We’re going to make an extremely expensive production which is going to be very loosely connected to LotR, and we’re going to create a whole new setting, story, even characters out of whole cloth”? Good luck with that. Casual viewers would have had very little reason to be attracted to it, and purists would have complained that they’re creating something out of whole cloth. The problem here is that aside from a couple of vague reference to the blue wizards and a couple of stray sentences here and there, we have zero context for what the East is like except that they 1. are vaguely non-white and use elephants and 2. always team up with the bad guy of the day, whether that’s Morgoth or Sauron. To me, it’s one of the more uncomfortable parts of the LotR role that Tolkien stuck all the nonwhite people in a place where they were basically never even heard of except for when they were fighting against the good guys. 

That’s my personal feelings, of course. Regardless of those, there is not a world where it would have made any kind of business or story sense to take a massive risk making a story about an underdeveloped part of the lore, especially when there’s so much to explore in the lore already.

As for Sir Lenny Henry, he is 63 years old dude, he did NOT grow up at the same time as Tolkien nor share the same culture. I don't have much in common with someone who is 60 years old, seeing as they are far older than myself and grew up in a different cultural setting. Cultures change all the time. If you saw the culture of pre-WW1 England and compared it with post-WW2 England there would be more differences than you may realize, both in technology and how society works that would classify it as a different culture in everything but name. The English have existed for a very long time, but it would be pure stupidity to say that an Englishman in the 9-10th century is culturally identically to an Englishman one century later, under Norman rule.

You can believe what you want, but just because someone grew up in a culture, it doesn't make them entirely representative of said culture. Cultures are defined by the majority, it is why I can actually visually recognize different cultures from my own. It is why I can clearly see that the African culture that exists in the same place I grew up in, and they grew up in, is different to mine, and that the people who make up said culture are also different. As such, I actually respect that fact, and when I listen to their stories I could never ever imagine an adaptation of said story featuring a white actor, it is just plain disrespectful, insensitive and to be honest completely racist.

The existence of black people is not my point, what you are implying is that I have an issue with black people as a whole, and hence I hate it when I see them portrayed in the film. Right? That's far from the truth, what I have an issue with is appropriating a culture, be it by misrepresenting history or mythology and twisting it to represent what people believe now. It is not right and it is a slippery slope to follow. 

Adaptations should accurately portray the setting they aim to represent, it is abhorrent to think that it is somehow ok to do this just because you think you have good intentions by increasing diversity quotas, a product of modern political ideologies. People, and you included, should not aim to dismantle other cultures and mythologies to better represent a minority because there are other ways to represent a minority that do not involve appropriation of any kind.","so that makes it ok just because you happen to have the same skin tone or culture it means you can just rearrange it to represent what you want its not reality and it is counterfeit what youre saying doesnt make any sense at all its clutching at straws

35057,246,5,"test",1,"/r/lotr","Nah nah, Cat's on point here.

After publishing LotR, Tolkien added more to the story of Eregion than what's seen in the Appendices. One of the stories in The Unfinished Tales depicts Galadriel establishing Eregion. She uses its location to try and repair diplomatic ties with the dwarves of Moria in preparation for the darkness that will inevitably come.

Celebrimbor is among the Noldor in Galadriel and Celeborn's company, and the chief smith of Eregion. I can't find any particular mention of him being an ally of the dwarves in the UT, but given his ""almost 'dwarfish' obsession with crafts"" I'm sure they got along like what Appendix B said.

If the show's using source material as a guide (all legal rights issues aside) I'd expect to see both Galadriel and Celebrimbor in the ""dwarf diplomacy"" arc.

Edit: Figure I'd go ahead and add it, but the only major detail that conflicts between the account of Eregion's founding given in Appendix B vs what's written in The Unfinished Tales is the year of its founding.

Appendix B:

>750. Eregion founded by the Noldor

UT:

>Celeborn and Galadriel therefore went eastwards, about the year 700 of the Second Age, and established the (primarily, but by no means solely) Noldorin realm of Eregion.

Generally people hand-wave the timeline discrepency by saying 50 years passed between when Celeborn and Galadriel began traveling eastwards, and when the realm was properly established. But in all likelihood Tolkien just fudged and/or changed the date.

To Celebrimbor as ""Lord of Eregion,"" this would also still be the case in the UT's telling of events. In that tale, the elven smiths revolt against Celeborn and Galadriel's rule under the influence and direction of Annatar (Sauron). Galadriel flees through Moria and establishes Lorien in the forests south. Celeborn refuses to trust the dwarves and thus doesn't enter Moria, but Celebrimbor allows him to stay in Eregion unharmed. ***Then*** Celebrimbor is Lord of Eregion.

The revolt and events leading up to it occurred between 1350-1400. It wasn't until a century later that the elves began forging the rings of power.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Final Edit:  
It's worth mentioning, as clarified in the introduction of The Unfinished Tales, that Tolkien continued to revise and refine his Legendarium throughout the remainder of his life. There are many different versions of events depicted, some more recent than others, some more consistent with The Hobbit and LotR than others.

So some of this comes down to personal choice in what one considers ""canon."" Are the books Tolkien published in his life the definitive ""canon,"" with everything else being a draft or myth? Is the most recent version of any particular event as it existed in his drafts to be considered the more canon one? Is whichever the most commonly agreed upon version the canon one?

That's up for debate. And Tolkien fans have been having that very debate ever since he died. 

Don't get me wrong. While there is a line to be crossed here in terms of depicting what's ""canon,"" more often than not people don't understand exactly how blurry that line is when you get into the wider Tolkien Legendarium.

The Second Age in particular is especially fuzzily defined. So personally, I prefer to think of Tolkien's Legendarium as just that; a series of legends and myths. And as with real-world legend and myth, it gets retold a bit with each generation and each telling. Hence, all the in-lore discrepancies and retellings.","nah nah cats on point here

after publishing lotr tolkien added more to the story of eregion than whats seen in the appendices one of the stories in the unfinished tales depicts galadriel establishing eregion she uses its location to try and repair diplomatic ties with the dwarves of moria in preparation for the darkness that will inevitably come

celebrimbor is among the noldor in galadriel and celeborns company and the chief smith of eregion i cant find any particular mention of him being an ally of the dwarves in the ut but given his almost dwarfish obsession with crafts im sure they got along like what appendix b said

if the shows using source material as a guide all legal rights issues aside id expect to see both galadriel and celebrimbor in the dwarf diplomacy arc

edit figure id go ahead and add it but the only major detail that conflicts between the account of eregions founding given in appendix b vs whats written in the unfinished tales is the year of its founding

appendix b

 eregion founded by the noldor

ut

celeborn and galadriel therefore went eastwards about the year  of the second age and established the primarily but by no means solely noldorin realm of eregion

generally people handwave the timeline discrepency by saying  years passed between when celeborn and galadriel began traveling eastwards and when the realm was properly established but in all likelihood tolkien just fudged andor changed the date

to celebrimbor as lord of eregion this would also still be the case in the uts telling of events in that tale the elven smiths revolt against celeborn and galadriels rule under the influence and direction of annatar sauron galadriel flees through moria and establishes lorien in the forests south celeborn refuses to trust the dwarves and thus doesnt enter moria but celebrimbor allows him to stay in eregion unharmed then celebrimbor is lord of eregion

the revolt and events leading up to it occurred between  it wasnt until a century later that the elves began forging the rings of power

final edit  
its worth mentioning as clarified in the introduction of the unfinished tales that tolkien continued to revise and refine his legendarium throughout the remainder of his life there are many different versions of events depicted some more recent than others some more consistent with the hobbit and lotr than others

so some of this comes down to personal choice in what one considers canon are the books tolkien published in his life the definitive canon with everything else being a draft or myth is the most recent version of any particular event as it existed in his drafts to be considered the more canon one is whichever the most commonly agreed upon version the canon one

It should have been a dramatic scene where Boba Fett walks into their hiding place like a cold-blooded killer and murders all the enemy leaders who beg for mercy, like in the scene where Anakin kills the Separatist leaders on Mustafa. This would have made Cad Bane's statement true, created character development, and showed that Boba Fett is not the weak and powerless character that he has become. I guess it would be a little too similar to Anakin Skywalker's plot theme, but that is the only way I see they could have made the finale better.","the last episode was such a disappointment idk if i had too high expectations but the finale reminded me more of a marvel movie than star wars there was no character development in the whole series and every character that seemed interesting was either killed or neglected like cad bane and the alien woman garsa fwip running the sanctuary they also managed to destroy mandos character in the final episode when he told boba that he was willing to sacrifice himself the mando we know from the mandalorian would have done everything to keep grogu safe which he would not be able to do if he died fighting boba fetts battle if i could change one little thing about the last episode it was the scene where fennec shand kills all the enemy leaders it should have been a dramatic scene where boba fett walks into their hiding place like a coldblooded killer and murders all the enemy leaders who beg for mercy like in the scene where anakin kills the separatist leaders on mustafa this would have made cad banes statement true created character development and showed that boba fett is not the weak and powerless character that he has become i guess it would be a little too similar to anakin skywalkers plot theme but that is the only way i see they could have made the finale better"

>Dunno but for me that's the good way of fanservice.

It's an issue when you have a worldscape the size of the galaxy and this stuff keeps happening, just through contrivance and convenience just happing to keep running into the same stable of people. He already showed up in BB, doing the exact same thing, like what, is he the only guy in the business?

Where it works: Somebody needs to find somebody who knows Boba Fett for some reason and wants information about him? They get tipped off about a line to one of his old colleagues, they end up knocking on doors, they find him, bam, opens up the door, it's the blue guy. It makes sense, they have a history, he's still alive and if the plot needs him to be accessible that's easy to write.

For example: Luke showing up in Mando S2. He doesn't just show up out of nowhere: Grogu specifically called out through the Force for any Jedi, and he's already known to be the only one really running around, specifically looking for other Force users and get that train moving again (although that's carefully not thrown in your face to foreshadow something) and once he senses Grogu he's powerful enough to track him. He's able to do the grand-entrance-cavalry thing as well as the ""holy shit it's actually him"" angle and it doesn't come off as forced fanservice. It was a reveal, but not a contrivance.

Where it drags, is the cartel having someone who works for them, needing to deliver a message, and it just so happens to be Cad Bane, as a coincidence. Out of all the bounty hunters/hitmen/mercs in the galaxy in the downfall of the Empire and it just so happens to be him? Especially since he showed up *the exact same way* in another show?  Like is Cad Bane the only guy pulling jobs in the galaxy anymore, did everybody else hang their guns up and retire? It was executed well, he had good screen presence and the CGI was done well, and it wouldn't quite bug me as much if we didn't already see it before.

If you watch Better Call Saul it does a fantastic job of bringing in established characters without making it feel like contrived, forced say-the-line-Bart fanservice for the sake of fanservice.

I could (and actually did originally) write an entire essay of a comment on this, but the best way I can sum it up is this: if the story had always intended for Palpatine to return, then why does it feel like the story of the sequel trilogy prior to TRoS would have made more sense if TRoS was building up to a reveal of Luke being Rey's father and that the final battle was going to be between Rey and Kylo Ren, with Ren in charge of the First Order?

Edit because I've finally had some coffee and feel I should explain the ""Luke is Rey's father"" idea: my thought here is that it makes sense to have that be the reveal because, well, Rey is powerful in the Force (so why not have her be part of the Skywalker family line?) and it would make perfect sense, if the retcon of Rey being unconnected to anyone HAD to happen, for Ren to lie about her origins because the idea of the head of the First Order causing the daughter of Luke to kill her father is EXACTLY the type of manipulation one would expect from a Sith, which would have also made his manipulation failing in TLJ and Luke's death being unconnected to his manipulations actually work better as proof of how much Ren is not actually as powerful a Sith as he thinks he is.

20187,145,5,"test",0,"/r/StarWars","Rey's theme is connected to Palpatine's theme if you care to dig into music theory of the two songs. Though Rey's theme is connected to a lot of other Star Wars themes, but I think the connection to Palpatine's theme is the strongest.

We don't know the origins of Rey in TFA, but when we first see her she's inside the wreckage of Star Destroyer. And she learns the force quickly, remember Yoda's warning the that dark side is quicker?

Given the dark side Rey vision in RoS, I'm almost certain the plan was always for Rey to have had a connection to the Emperor and for her to go to the dark side in the second movie. That would be a great second movie twist, wouldn't it? 

But you don't want to give it away in the first movie, so they played the cards close to their chest in many respects. But someone gave John Williams the heads up so he could make Rey's theme able to transition to Palpatine's theme seamlessly, and they put a few things that would make sense if you watched it again knowing the twist. Like Rey's first appearance in the franchise taking place inside an old Star Destroyer. Rey is the legacy of the Emperor, and the location she first appears in is also the legacy of the Emperor.

Obviously, they chickened out on doing that. As a result, TLJ was basically pointless. And the audience found TLJ to be boring, because basically nothing happened. So then they brought JJ Abrams back to try to course correct back, but it was too late at that point.

Now I wouldn't go so far to say that they intended to actually bring Palpatine back in the flesh. Maybe his evil spirit or a hologram or whatever. But since Snoke was deleted as a character, they basically said ""fuck it, just bring back Palpatine"" because there wasn't much else to do at that point. 

Rey was meant to have some connection to the Emperor from the beginning, TLJ dropped that idea, dropped Snoke, dropped Luke Skywalker, and after the Carrie Fisher died, there wasn't really anything that could be done other than schlock. And nobody does schlock better than Palpatine. And since Rey was meant to be connected to Palpatine anyway, they did that too. Though it wasn't possible to have that story really work in one movie, but what else could they do?","reys theme is connected to palpatines theme if you care to dig into music theory of the two songs though reys theme is connected to a lot of other star wars themes but i think the connection to palpatines theme is the strongest

I think the mentality was much more about wanting to capitalize on the license as quickly as possible, getting a new Star Wars main series film in theaters as soon as possible, and as much of a guarantee of being ""good"" as possible too.

It would take time to plan out a full trilogy, after all, and then you'd have to find a good creative team that's willing to stand by the franchise for all three films. And meanwhile, you'd have investors wondering why it's taking 4-5 years to put out a movie that everyone knows will be gangbusters profitable, even Phantom Menace made a billion dollars, and that was widely reviled at the time!

So, they went with a more conservative approach. Just make one movie for now, and bring in JJ Abrams to direct, a man that... while not a good writer or really having a good grasp on storytelling in general (his mystery boxes doomed the sequels), he knows how to turn a good script into an exciting, energetic movie with fully engaged actors and exceptional technical execution.

He's especially good when there's a fairly blank slate that he can work with, where he's not having to deal with pesky continuity issues.

While I agree that Disney should have planned out the full trilogy itself, I get why they didn't. But while I do love The Last Jedi, it definitely was a mistake for Disney to not go ""okay, now that we've shown that we can make a Star Wars movie that's good, lets plan out Episodes 8 and 9 and shoot them back to back""...","honestly i dont think so exactly i think the mentality was much more about wanting to capitalize on the license as quickly as possible getting a new star wars main series film in theaters as soon as possible and as much of a guarantee of being good as possible too

it would take time to plan out a full trilogy after all and then youd have to find a good creative team thats willing to stand by the franchise for all three films and meanwhile youd have investors wondering why its taking  years to put out a movie that everyone knows will be gangbusters profitable even phantom menace made a billion dollars and that was widely reviled at the time

so they went with a more conservative approach just make one movie for now and bring in jj abrams to direct a man that while not a good writer or really having a good grasp on storytelling in general his mystery boxes doomed the sequels he knows how to turn a good script into an exciting energetic movie with fully engaged actors and exceptional technical execution

hes especially good when theres a fairly blank slate that he can work with where hes not having to deal with pesky continuity issues

while i agree that disney should have planned out the full trilogy itself i get why they didnt but while i do love the last jedi it definitely was a mistake for disney to not go okay now that weve shown that we can make a star wars movie thats good lets plan out episodes  and  and shoot them back to back"

40054,148,5,"test",1,"/r/lotr","I've seen no measurable signs that Wheel of Time succeeded, though. It's very easy to fudge numbers and proclaim that your show is ""the Number #1 New Show"" by some really obscure metric, like weekly streaming demands on your own streaming website, as opposed to comparisons with others. 

In terms of the actual signs that a show has made an impact, though? I haven't seen *anyone* talking about Wheel of Time outside of the very eclectic circles online where it was already hyped up. I'm certain that a decent number of people watched the show. But none of them were talking about it at the level of *Game of Thrones*, ever. Not even half that. Season 1 ended, and outside of the Wheel of Time subreddits, I've seen almost zero threads about it on this site. I haven't seen a single mainstream meme utilizing an image from the show. It hasn't penetrated into the culture.

Now, LOTR will have an inherently larger appeal, but even then, if you're looking at success purely in *financial* terms, you're sort of missing the whole point of my comment. Many, many films and TV Shows have been financially successful and also poorly written. Look at the Star Wars Sequels. Maybe you can give Force Awakens and Last Jedi a pass, but I've never seen anyone honestly try to defend The Rise of Skywalker as anything more than a flaming pile of garbage. And that movie *still* made over a billion dollars, simply because it was Star Wars, not because it was good...

I'm not measuring this show's success by how much money it makes, and I don't think anyone here is. We didn't judge the Peter Jackson films that way, and if they had been exactly the same, but bombed in theaters, I think we'd still say they were good. This show could absolutely take in cash and still be a failure from a *storytelling* perspective, and that's the avenue I think is most likely. I don't think that's a delusional perspective, not when the last few years have shown us a host of franchises fall prey to terrible writing.

I'm also confused as to why you think Tolkien fans aren't at the very least a sub-primary audience for this show. Who else would even have the requisite knowledge of the Second Age to be interested in this? Amazon is trying to capitalize on the love of the films, and the showrunners themselves have said that part of the reason they're excited to do this show is because of the large, extant fanbase.

I think the Clone Wars does a really great job of displaying just how bad things had gotten.  You're basically watching the Jedi Order fall in real-time, and it's the first domino to go.

No I know. I understood that and agree. My criticism is that one of the two best plots in the series was Mando season 2.5 and that is BAD. If this is a show about Greedo then that makes sense, but a show about Boba Fett? Like I said, the walk and talks, the boring politics, basically the entire crime family storyline was garbage. Then there's overall the direction they took Boba. I'm not against him evolving and leaving the ruthless killer part of himself in the past but all the walking around with no helmet, talking a bunch and being a softy just isn't it. I think for the most part you agree with those takes, that it isn't the familiar stuff that you're criticizing but the core part of the show (Boba) wasn't written well.   


>I will stand by Ahsoka was entirely unnecessary -- that's the only piece that (while emotionally worked for me - because I love the character) just didn't serve the story. She's not part of Grogu's training. She's clearly not a part of Skywalker's Jedi. ANY character, even a new one, could have done that role without skipping a beat. She was a distraction that did nothing to further Boba's story.

Not that any of what happened in that episode made sense in a Boba Fett spin-off, but for all we know that's the only scene we'll get of Ahsoka and Luke together. For all we know Ahsoka never sees Luke in her spin-off and she dies at the end of it. I think people would look back on that scene with a different viewpoint if that is the case. Happy that even if it didn't make a TON of sense, Filoni stuck it in there so his baby (Ahsoka) could finally meet and be in a scene with Anakins son.

Here's three examples:

*The Shining*: Stanley Kubrick makes significant departures including changing the entire ending but the film is a critical and financial success, in spite of King's vehement objections.

*Jurassic Park*: Almost no character resembles their book counterpart in either appearance or personality, major themes are changed, ignored, or added. The ending is also different. Yet Jurassic Park remains one of the greatest films of all time.

*Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings*: Plot twist! While of the films mentioned here, this is the most faithful, it still has significant departures, some of which would be decried as ""woke"" today and let's not forget that Christopher Tolkien thought it butchered his father's work.

Among the changes are: cutting Tom Bombadil, the Old Forest, making Merry and Pippin come along accidentally, swapping out Glorfindel for Arwen (Peter Jackson hates men and has a feminist agenda!) Completely changing Aragorn's personality and motivation, completely changing Faramir's personality for the duration of the *Two Towers* (he gets better), Pippin having to trick the Ents into fighting Saruman, having the Army of the Dead show up at the Battle of Pelennor Fields, cutting out the Scourging of the Shire

Galadriel was much younger then, makes sense to display her this way. People have been taking offense to the “piss and vinegar” comment (I’ll say, super cliche description, but let’s leave that alone for a sec) but the elves of the silmarillion were Wildin out. She’ll also probably still be powerful, shot in the dark there.

This was done by Peter Jackson’s trilogy in a few instances, most notably the multiple years it took Frodo to move on with the ring being reduced to a single night in the movies. Very common to do this with cinematic storytelling in order to keep the plot moving. (Did we really expect 2000 years of content? That’s like 20 seasons they’d be planning on from jump)

Harfoots were around in the second age

I’ll keep the elves and dwarves short and say it’s a superficial change, one that doesn’t impact lore deeply whatsoever. Appreciate if it’s not the image of Tolkien you want painted, but it’s within the bounds of artistic license to change, and as the link states, the Tolkien estate co-signed. 

They might change more! Or maybe that’s it! It’s just not a reason to write the show off as bad yet, IMO. But if you hate it already just rewatch the movies and stick to the books, nothin wrong with that!","one by one

Episode I: The doors opening to reveal Darth Mail and John Williams choosing that moment to go nuts.

Episode II: “I don’t like sand.” (I’m sorry, but it’s just so *bad.* The other prequels have their redeeming moments, but I can’t think of any for II)

Episode III: The actually pretty powerful scene of Darth Vader’s mask being put on for the first time (before the cringey “NOOOO” bit).

Episode IV: The Twin Suns scene. The music, the cinematography, Hamill’s expression, it’s just enchanting as a moment.

Episode V: This one’s easy. That moment we collectively had the rug pulled out from under us as it’s revealed that Darth Vader is Luke’s father.

Episode VI: The emperor’s throne room scene. The whole thing. All of it. Except the “NO, NO, NO!” bit that they gave Vader in the re-release. It didn’t need that.

Episode VII: The establishing scene where we see Rey’s daily routine.

Episode VIII: The duel between Luke and Kylo Ren.

Episode IX: The part where it’s revealed that Rey is a Palpatine. This is the only other scene I go back to in a bad way. This was a bad idea and I wish they’d let Rian Johnson stay on the project for at least a sense of consistency between the two movies instead of basically giving the Last Jedi the finger.


In the Star Wars Stories:

Rogue One: The hallway scene with Vader. No question.

Solo: Probably the Kessel Run scene, I dunno.


In the shows:

Clone Wars: Oh, this is a tough one. Probably the one where Fives dies.

Rebels: Everything with Thrawn. XD (But honestly, Kanan’s death scene is probably my favorite individual moment)

The Mandalorian: The moment when Din Djarin decides to go back for Grogu.

41218,384,5,"test",1,"/r/lotr",">You missed my point entirely. My point in my very first message is that it doesn't need to matter to the narrative. Skin color doesn't matter just like Dwarves' height or elves' ears.

Round and round we go. When you responded to me, and made the ""what if we just replaced the Hobbits with two-headed snakes?"" comment, what exactly was your point? Because it seems to me that you are being disingenuous.

You could absolutely have a Lord of the Rings starring two-headed snake Hobbits. It's a bit more jarring than say, just having black hobbits, black elves, or black Gandalf. Those are not jarring to me, but you seem to have a problem with it, despite saying, ""now, don't get me wrong, I'm not against inclusivity"".

We could make a version of Lord of the Rings that is as wild as Jodorowsky's proposal for Dune. I'd pay money to see that, but at a certain point it gains a ship of Theseus quality. Race swapping characters changes nothing about the story. A future LotR story could feature black Elrond. So what?

I get that the idea of a black elf is preposterous and immersion breaking to you, I'm asking why. It's not narratively important, the textual argument for it is not even that strong, and there are real world benefits to including more people in the universe.

>Racism is never over. But it's not a white people's thing, it's human inherent nature. White people are racist. Black people are racist. Humans are tribal creatures in general.

Wow, insightful stuff.

>But you have a choice to be a bitter loser who plays victim and puts his blame on others, or step up and be the best person you can be and work hard to make something out of yourself. World is unfair, no one awes you anything, it's on you to succeed and overcome your odds, when the cards you are given are against you.

When did Ben Shapiro hijack your brain? Is that you Dr. Peterson? Pull yourself up by the boostraps, bucko!

>I am 100% pro inclusivity, when it is based on merit and talent. When someone is hired based on diversity quota, it devalues their achievement and takes away the chance of those who deserved it more.

And you think that the handful of PoC actors who make it into these roles are ""diversity"" hires for what reason exactly? Please show me more evidence than, ""my feelings"".

I like how you keep trying to smuggle your ""pro equality, not pro equity"" talkingpoint from a previous comment back into the conversation. When I asked you directly to expound on it, you weirdly didn't. Now, here it is again, but this time disguised as ""merit and talent"". The meritocracy is a lie, just like white Santa Claus. There will \*never\* be a society where the winners of one generation don't heavily influence the winners of the next.

Do you ever wonder why, if we live in such meritocracies, the outlook of person's life is heavily determined by zip/area code? If everyone is equal, why would there be such disparities? Gasp, it is because that maybe, just maybe, that the playing field isn't level, and that we must acknowledge and respond to that if we are to overcome the pernicious positive feedback loop that leads to ever expanding inequality?

>Lets recap. Black people sold other people to white people

Careful, there, mate. It almost sounds like you are attempting to shift the responsibility of chattel slavery off onto the shoulder of black people.

>The impact black people experienced made them very, bitter, racist and pessimistic. Some black people choose to let go of hate, to better themselves, do the best they can to succeed in life given their unfortunate situation. Others gave up, blame society, indulge in their hate for white people and the system.

This is definitely the closest you've come to out-and-out racism. Why are you just declaring them bitter, racist, and pessimistic? What do you mean by ""unfortunate situation""? Who ""gave up"", and ""blame society"", and ""indulge in their hate for white people""? Oh, is this mask off time? Are you about to reveal your power level?

>Did I get everything right? Or I need to attend the nearest CRT reeducation camp.

I wouldn't even have you farm potatoes. Po-ta-toes. The first time you heard of CRT was last week when discovered it on some alt-right forum, and now you think it is a trump card for arguments like this one. ""Ah, hah! Got you, libtard! Bet you didn't think I'd heard of CRT!""

Maybe just read about CRT, a bit, before you clumsily trot it out in an argument like you know what you are talking about. I know nothing about CRT as it's a dense field of academic legal scholarship. You can agree with their analytical framework and its conclusions, or not, but to reach the point of being able to treat it with any seriousness, you'd first have to ""do the work"". Or, you can just admit it is the latest conservative boogey man used to dupe tools like you into impeding progress in matters of racial justice and equality, Go read about the [dystopian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_race_theory) ""memory laws"" that all this anti-CRT nonsense is leading to:

>Timothy D. Snyder, historian and professor at Yale University, has called these new state laws memory laws — ""government actions designed to guide public interpretation of the past"". Early memory laws were intended to protect victim groups, such as from revisionism attempts by holocaust deniers, but most recently have been used by Russia to protect ""the feelings of the powerful"", then by Donald Trump's 1776 Report in January 2021, followed by Republican-led legislatures submitting these bills. Snyder called the Idaho version ""Kafkaesque in its censorship: It affirms freedom of speech and then bans divisive speech.""\[172\]

At the very least, try to be a bit more nuanced. Maybe even, dare I say it, grow up?","you missed my point entirely my point in my very first message is that it doesnt need to matter to the narrative skin color doesnt matter just like dwarves height or elves ears

round and round we go when you responded to me and made the what if we just replaced the hobbits with twoheaded snakes comment what exactly was your point because it seems to me that you are being disingenuous

you could absolutely have a lord of the rings starring twoheaded snake hobbits its a bit more jarring than say just having black hobbits black elves or black gandalf those are not jarring to me but you seem to have a problem with it despite saying now dont get me wrong im not against inclusivity

we could make a version of lord of the rings that is as wild as jodorowskys proposal for dune id pay money to see that but at a certain point it gains a ship of theseus quality race swapping characters changes nothing about the story a future lotr story could feature black elrond so what

i get that the idea of a black elf is preposterous and immersion breaking to you im asking why its not narratively important the textual argument for it is not even that strong and there are real world benefits to including more people in the universe

racism is never over but its not a white peoples thing its human inherent nature white people are racist black people are racist humans are tribal creatures in general

wow insightful stuff

but you have a choice to be a bitter loser who plays victim and puts his blame on others or step up and be the best person you can be and work hard to make something out of yourself world is unfair no one awes you anything its on you to succeed and overcome your odds when the cards you are given are against you

when did ben shapiro hijack your brain is that you dr peterson pull yourself up by the boostraps bucko

i am  pro inclusivity when it is based on merit and talent when someone is hired based on diversity quota it devalues their achievement and takes away the chance of those who deserved it more

and you think that the handful of poc actors who make it into these roles are diversity hires for what reason exactly please show me more evidence than my feelings

i like how you keep trying to smuggle your pro equality not pro equity talkingpoint from a previous comment back into the conversation when i asked you directly to expound on it you weirdly didnt now here it is again but this time disguised as merit and talent the meritocracy is a lie just like white santa claus there will never be a society where the winners of one generation dont heavily influence the winners of the next

do you ever wonder why if we live in such meritocracies the outlook of persons life is heavily determined by ziparea code if everyone is equal why would there be such disparities gasp it is because that maybe just maybe that the playing field isnt level and that we must acknowledge and respond to that if we are to overcome the pernicious positive feedback loop that leads to ever expanding inequality

lets recap black people sold other people to white people

careful there mate it almost sounds like you are attempting to shift the responsibility of chattel slavery off onto the shoulder of black people

Moria has many doors, those doors are invisible if the one searching those doors doesn't meet some criteria, like a certain time of day while looking at it, a certain constelation being in the sky or any other moon or space related thing. To add to that, Khazad-dum (Moria) fell a long - and I mean a LONG - time ago. The dwarves knew of ""Durins Bane"" but with time they forgot what exactly it was. Balin went back after the events of ""the Hobbit"" to fight for Moria and won. He took almost the entire kingdom back (or so he thought) and rebuild many things. At that point he sent the news that everything was fine and became ruler of Moria. Quickly after that they were absolutely overrun by the orcs and were slowly but surely pushed back and starved out, after a few minor battles the survivers retreated to the chamber of mazarbul, laid Balin who was shot by 3 arrow at night to rest and wrote about their last days in the book they find. The other dwarves in Erebor didn't know about that and thought Moria was fine - no, noone ever traded with those dwarves, since Saurons forces actively tried to ally themselves with these dwarves and after they failed at those attempts they fought a full blown war. That's why we never saw other dwarven armies arive to help them at any point. 



The doors were made by Celebrimbor, a great elven craftsman, who forged the 3 elven rings of power. He was a great friend of the dwarves of Durin and therefore used the elvish words as a sign of friendship. But after Moria fell and the dwarves and elves began to hate each other, the knowledge became lost.



Flying to mordor was never an option. Sauron has incredibly good airial defense. From flying creatures, swarms of bats, clouds of shadows, fire rains to an ungodly amount of archers and balistas. Gandalf meant that they should run away and not try to save him. 



Aragorn knew that everyone in the fellowship would fall to the ring, so he knew Frodo and Sam had better chances on their own.

Yes, and it's easy to use those cases to manufacture an ""issue"" that can be used to co-opt the space. They do this deliberately in many cases - Star Wars and the controversy over there being a black stormtrooper was one fairly notable example. This can be a heavy subject, but if you're at all curious about it I recommend giving [*How to Radicalize a Normie*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P55t6eryY3g) a watch, and/or the rest of the series it's part of.

This is where the beard thing is annoying to me, lol. Diversity is great, there's no real reason a group of dwarves _couldn't_ have dark skin, sure - it's not something Tolkien went out of his way to specify, and the underlying source material (nordic myth) had dwarves with dark skin (though iirc it was more dark gray, but whatever). However removing the beard is removing *in-universe* diversity for basically no reason, and on that front they could definitely do better.","any controversy that vaguely involves races and ethnicity falls all too easily into the american leftright divide

Episode 10 should reveal 1000 hidden planets, each with 1000 tie fighters, each capable of destroying an entire solar system with one shot.

2) Why was she so cryptic about being there to save them.  Instead of saying something over comms like “I’m here and I’m going to clear these guys out, so keep your heads down” she just told them to keep their heads down. 

3) Where was she supposed to be firing from when she hits the command center? Is the roof not enclosed? If not, why wouldn’t they just easily see where the shots are coming from after she takes out like the first one or two guys? Instead they just stand there being confused.

For one thing, the dwarven princess isn’t “African,” just like the white dwarves aren’t European. They belong to Middle-Earth. If you go back far enough in time, the first humans to migrate into Europe were black and central Asian, anyway.

If you want to complain about Amazon applying modern sensibilities to casting choices, then you have to recognize that you’re also applying your modern sensibilities to the topic; your idea of black people as African and white people as European is just another modern distinction. Go back in time far enough, and it’s not true. 

What matters much more than skin color or geographic origin is culture. This is why the “BLM mob” doesn’t like it when minority characters are changed. Very often, Hollywood takes something that is culturally important, whether it’s a traditional story or historical figure, and commodifies it to make a quick buck.  

You are certainly allowed to be offended for the same reason. But it’s important to keep that basis of culture in mind. Which culture would Amazon be exploiting by adding black dwarves? Nordic culture? English culture? “White people” isn’t a culture to itself. 

I’ve also noticed that this actress’s race is usually the first thing a critic points out. I’ve never seen anyone complain about Frodo not being 50 years old in the films like he is in the books, for example. I understand criticisms that focus on costuming, plot holes, or changes from the book. But when you open reddit and the first and only thing you have to say is about skin color, that’s reductive and disrespectful. 

It’s worth noting that Tolkien’s world is polycultural and polylingual, and the interactions between his diverse civilizations are the most interesting parts of the book. The conflicts between the men of Laketown and the dwarves of the lonely mountain, or the strained alliance between Gondor and the horse-masters, or the town of Bree where hobbit civilization mingles with the world of men are the most interesting parts of Tolkien’s world.

""Boba joins the Tusken Raiders"" was interesting, at the very least, with a bit of world building and backstory.

It almost felt like his arc was written backwards. 

If you flip it, after Boba kills Bib Fortuna (wants a castle, needs a bacta tank, just because), Boba reluctantly starts doing crime lord things to fix the problems caused by the power vacuum he made (Tusken Raider flashbacks informing why he wants to help someone in need), builds some temporary alliances, fights the Pykes, ends up as the crime lord of Tatooine because everyone respects him (and his rancor).

if you flip it after boba kills bib fortuna wants a castle needs a bacta tank just because boba reluctantly starts doing crime lord things to fix the problems caused by the power vacuum he made tusken raider flashbacks informing why he wants to help someone in need builds some temporary alliances fights the pykes ends up as the crime lord of tatooine because everyone respects him and his rancor its not a particularly good or unique story and it would probably feature the same side characters but im trying to think of scenarios where his character would be consistently moving forward from where it was at the end of the mandalorian"

43093,138,5,"test",1,"/r/lotr","My biggest gripes with LOTR and The Hobbit films are the 'improvements' Jackson's writing team adapted into the story.  I would even say there are parts of the Bakshi film which are superior to Jackson's offering.

The biggest gripe being where Frodo is stabbed by the Wraith.  Arwen comes to save him and flee him across the ford into Rivendell.

WTF?!?  This part was supposed to show Frodo's inner strength and character.  Where he is being taken by the ring but continues on, knowing the Wraiths are still coming for them.  He has to gather his last bit of strength to attempt to escape while his friends can do NOTHING, to reach the Ford of Rivendell.  He makes it across, draws his blade in his last show of defiance before passing out, while the Wraiths are washed away by the river. I always felt Jackson cheapened what should have been a huge, climactic moment in Fellowship.  IMO, Bakshi handled this scene 100x better.

The Battle for Helm's Deep.  All hope seems lost when the men of Rohan realize they'll have to fight alone.  But then, the Elves show up.  Man & Elf team up Marvel-style to take on the Uruk-Hai!  There's even a part where Legolas rides a shield!  So COOL!  At the end, when all hope is really lost, Aragorn comes up with a brilliant idea to ride out and attack, Hollywood hero archetype-style!  The plan works and the day is saved by Gandalf and the Rohirim!  This always bothered the hell out of me.

What?!?!  The Men of Rohan don't need to be saved by Elves.  They have to dig deep and fight, with no one to help, and Saruman launching fireballs from Isengard.  Thus paving the way for the Uruk-Hai to storm inside Helm's Deep and take the castle.  Knowing they're finished, and having balls of steel, Theoden essentially says 'Fuck it, let's go die and kill as many as we can and be remembered in songs and tales!'  They take out many Uruks until they're completely surrounded.  They're then saved by Gandalf and the Rohirim at the last moment.","my biggest gripes with lotr and the hobbit films are the improvements jacksons writing team adapted into the story  i would even say there are parts of the bakshi film which are superior to jacksons offering

Not even necessarily white-supremacist; I don't think it's likely that the orcs were meant to be analogous to people of African descent; if anything, maybe Eurasian steppe tribes?

I've genuinely enjoyed a lot of Shakespearian adaptations that had black actors playing non-black roles in them, and felt that their acting ability and their ability to personify the characters in their personalities far outweighed any benefit that physical similarity to the author's mental picture of the character would've played. 

That said, I don't think I'd be the only one who'd be a little uncomfortable with like...white folks shoehorned into what were meant to be faithful adaptations of African, Native American or other folktales from non-European cultural traditions.

Lord of the Rings was written as an intentionally European story. If that makes it unsuitable for adaptation...maybe that's okay? Maybe we can accept it as a product of its time and not insist on changing its essence  to pretend it's something it's not?

I think there may be more and less graceful ways to implement diversity in LOTR, but I also think diversity is always going to feel ""forced"" when the status-quo is a detrimental lack thereof.

i think Disney wanted the 2nd live action show released to skew more kid-friendly, and it just so happened that Favreau wrote a story that (he felt) needed Mando to come out first. which may have been a marketing 'mistake' when considering how much more conducive Fett would have been to weightier action and grittier tone. not to mention grogu is a perfect kid-centric marketable character.

Above quotes are from Parma Eldalamberon 17 and Nature of Middle-earth.

In Unfinished Tales there's yet another wholly different version of Galadriel during the WotE&S where she apparently retreated from Eregion after its fall and ""joined with Gil-Galad in Lindon"". I should note that the Battle of Eregion was long, Sauron assaulted Eriador in 1695 and Eregion fell in 1697. Then three years later or so Sauron assaulted Lindon. So going by this other version of Galadriel where she retreated to Lindon, she most likely also fought in the rest of the War of the Elves and Sauron

Tolkien was still revising her First Age story and had not given much thought to finishing Second Age story in last years of his life. If he had finally finished her First Age story and returned to finishing her Second Age story, we would've known where was she in the latter half of the Second Age. We also would've known where was she during the first 1000 years of the Third Age. There's just many gaps in her story. Tolkien never really wrote what happened to Galadriel or Celeborn in this period of time (1701 SA - 1050 TA).  We don't even know if she attended to her daughter's wedding! That doesn't necessarily mean she did not just because there's a gap in her history.

13300,371,5,"test",0,"/r/StarWars","Quick quick thoughts, I'll give a bit more in depth thoughts later:  
1) Holy plot armor for our main characters. Fett, Dinn, Krssstan et all   
can take about a thousand blaster bolts. The Rancor can get blasted up   
front and upclose, stabbed, burned in his mouth, etc. (I'm a bit more ok  
 with the Rancor sustaining the injuries, than say the wookiee who just   
shrugs off about 30 blaster bolts and acts like it didn't do a damn   
thing to him  
2) I honestly never felt like actively rooting for bad guys before, but   
after seeing the ""In the Name of Honor"" as the episode title, and then   
seeing Fett/Din fight alone in the streets.... I was actively rooting   
for the Pykes because of the outlandish way I knew Fett and Co would win  
3) The battle felt.... repetitive and nonsensical at every turn. Its   
just a constant one upsmanship of people showing up. ""Oh you got   
that.... well I got this.... oh you got that.... I got this"" I never   
felt like any good guy was in any level of danger, and the parts with   
Sedaris for humor, drove that home even moreso. Because she's not   
getting killed, Grogu's not getting killed, Fett's not getting killed,   
Dinn's not getting killed, etc. I guess the only ""shock"" was that Cad   
Bane gets killed. But at this point, a) if you only watched this show,   
you have to wonder if he's the big bad, and b) he's only been in two   
episodes. For those who know Cad Bane, we know the character is old -   
like sixties plus minimum (legit not sure) we know they need some big   
death, so might as well be Bane here. Save him for the animated where he  
 looks better and is a lot less costly to use.  
4) Nothing felt earned. Nothing in this battle felt earned. It all felt   
contrived and just pointless. Holding out in Mos Espa, making it a big   
point that they stay in Mos Espa rather than the Palace, every character  
 has this special ability or can just ward off enemies, the droids can't  
 shoot fleeing people while only being 50 feet away, characters can take  
 40 shots to the face and survive, no one even makes smart choices. Good  
 guys and bad guys. If their holed up in one little building.... why not  
 just blow the freaking building up? This is Space 3000, you have   
infinite number of ways to do it. And they've already showed the bad   
guys to be without remorse or honor (ie. the terrorism act), so why not   
do it again? Why not send the Scorpion Droids first? And why even be   
running around them acting as targets (Pykes)?   
5) The episode devalued a lot of the previous episodes too. No Tuskens   
coming back. Cad Bane just uses the Tusken deaths as a way to try and   
goad Fett, so it shows that those flashbacks were primarily just for   
Fett's \[piss-poor\] ""character growth"", and not in anyway shape or form   
characters onto themselves other than plot vehicles. And to pad out this  
 show to 7 episodes. And thats including an entire Mandalorian episode   
in the mix. So many previous things just had a 5 second call back that   
got utilized here in the final, and was made to show ""see how things   
progress, like shows and real life do?!"" but it was all basically just   
done in the service of the idea. Hutts were a small obstacle... and they  
 just convinently left the Giant wookiee and Rancor for Fett that he   
ended up using on the Pykes. And this is why nothing feels earned. They   
check-marked things. ""Episode 1 he gets this, we'll use it in the   
finale"",  ""Episode 2 he gains this character, he'll use him in the   
finale"", etc. Which makes SENSE in storytelling, if its given gravitas   
and shown for more than 5 seconds. Like the Rancor, here it is, a gift,   
Fett rubs his face, says I want to ride it.... and lo and behold he   
comes in saving the day riding a Rancor.... whoever guessed that was   
gonna happen.... but we never see a single bit of progression with it   
other than free toy used. Same as Krrssstan, we don't see him really   
other than a Free Toy given and used. Him and Fett have no real scenes   
until halfway through this battle where Fett says, I'll give you a bacta  
 tank nap.  
   
6) Fennec Shand in this episode. Her entire attack on the head of the   
Syndicate feels once again - unearned/undeserved/too easy. If it was   
that simple to take out the entire head of the syndicate + mayor +   
turncoats. Why couldn't this have been done from the beginning? And she   
clearly doesn't care about stabbing in the back/shooting in the   
back/lynching, so its not even an honor thing. They could have just used  
 her to assassinate them at anytime. (Well, I guess the Twi'lek   
Majordomo only reveals that at the beginning of this episode, but once   
again, feels like an unearned bit of information, because you don't even  
 see her get there onscreen or anything. He gives her info, she goes,   
'ok, off I go to assassinate an entire building and single handedly win   
this war' derp de derp, hold the fort while I'm gone Mr. Boba.)  
7) After credit scene. Thank goodness we know that Cobb was in the bacta  
 tank, with the modder, and will live. Once again showing how little   
peril there is for any main character in this show. ""Take 50 shots to   
the face? Don't worry. Bacta Tank. But its only for good guys! So no Cad  
 Bane getting to use it!""  
8) Sadly, I'm not even satisfied by the ending and where the characters   
stand afterwards. Ok, so at the end, we have Dinn off with Grogu having   
adventures again, and its shown off screen that Grogu made the decision   
to leave the training \[shocker\]. (Also, does this mean R2 is completely   
able to fly the X-Wing back to Luke, or does it still need some kind of   
life form on board?) Fett, Shand, and his merry band are now running Mos  
 Espa / Eisley / Tatooine? Do we see Fett do more in the future, and if   
so in what capacity, and why would he now leave Tatooine? Was this   
really even enough to persuade the Pykes to leave Tatooine? Why were the  
 Pykes really there in the first place? Why are they bringing Spice from  
 Kessel to Tatooine and then to do what with it? What will Fett do as   
leader of Tatooine? How does he really benefit the people other than   
running out drug dealers?","quick quick thoughts ill give a bit more in depth thoughts later  
 holy plot armor for our main characters fett dinn krssstan et all   
can take about a thousand blaster bolts the rancor can get blasted up   
front and upclose stabbed burned in his mouth etc im a bit more ok  
 with the rancor sustaining the injuries than say the wookiee who just   
shrugs off about  blaster bolts and acts like it didnt do a damn   
thing to him  
 i honestly never felt like actively rooting for bad guys before but   
after seeing the in the name of honor as the episode title and then   
seeing fettdin fight alone in the streets i was actively rooting   
for the pykes because of the outlandish way i knew fett and co would win  
 the battle felt repetitive and nonsensical at every turn its   
just a constant one upsmanship of people showing up oh you got   
that well i got this oh you got that i got this i never   
felt like any good guy was in any level of danger and the parts with   
sedaris for humor drove that home even moreso because shes not   
getting killed grogus not getting killed fetts not getting killed   
dinns not getting killed etc i guess the only shock was that cad   
bane gets killed but at this point a if you only watched this show   
you have to wonder if hes the big bad and b hes only been in two   
episodes for those who know cad bane we know the character is old    
like sixties plus minimum legit not sure we know they need some big   
death so might as well be bane here save him for the animated where he  
 looks better and is a lot less costly to use  
 nothing felt earned nothing in this battle felt earned it all felt   
contrived and just pointless holding out in mos espa making it a big   
point that they stay in mos espa rather than the palace every character  
 has this special ability or can just ward off enemies the droids cant  
 shoot fleeing people while only being  feet away characters can take  
  shots to the face and survive no one even makes smart choices good  
 guys and bad guys if their holed up in one little building why not  
 just blow the freaking building up this is space  you have   
infinite number of ways to do it and theyve already showed the bad   
guys to be without remorse or honor ie the terrorism act so why not   
do it again why not send the scorpion droids first and why even be   
running around them acting as targets pykes   
 the episode devalued a lot of the previous episodes too no tuskens   
coming back cad bane just uses the tusken deaths as a way to try and   
goad fett so it shows that those flashbacks were primarily just for   
fetts pisspoor character growth and not in anyway shape or form   
characters onto themselves other than plot vehicles and to pad out this  
 show to  episodes and thats including an entire mandalorian episode   
in the mix so many previous things just had a  second call back that   
got utilized here in the final and was made to show see how things   
progress like shows and real life do but it was all basically just   
done in the service of the idea hutts were a small obstacle and they  
 just convinently left the giant wookiee and rancor for fett that he   
ended up using on the pykes and this is why nothing feels earned they   
checkmarked things episode  he gets this well use it in the   
finale  episode  he gains this character hell use him in the   
finale etc which makes sense in storytelling if its given gravitas   
and shown for more than  seconds like the rancor here it is a gift   
fett rubs his face says i want to ride it and lo and behold he   
comes in saving the day riding a rancor whoever guessed that was   
gonna happen but we never see a single bit of progression with it   
other than free toy used same as krrssstan we dont see him really   
other than a free toy given and used him and fett have no real scenes   
until halfway through this battle where fett says ill give you a bacta

 fennec shand in this episode her entire attack on the head of the

 tank with the modder and will live once again showing how little   
peril there is for any main character in this show take  shots to   
the face dont worry bacta tank but its only for good guys so no cad

 sadly im not even satisfied by the ending and where the characters

Rebels got significantly better towards the middle of season 2.  Further, I really really enjoyed seasons 3 and 4.  It is more serialized story telling and I liked seeing the rebellion building.

My guess being that the show was always going to be about the New Republic police/military/patrol/peace keepers/etc. With the idea being that Cara would feature prominently.

14220,276,5,"test",0,"/r/StarWars","I swear they just downplayed Boba to try and hype the other characters. Fennec has made him look straight up stupid multiple times over the season. Good to finally see the 'master assassin' part of Fennec played out rather than the parkour chase we got early on. 

Definitely amazing to see Boba riding the rancor and Din failing at it. Din has the symbol he earned, and Boba has his, I like that they finally displayed one facet of Boba that's 'greater' than the mandalorian. Of course we know of rancor imprinting now as well which adds into the rejection but I thought it a nice undertone. The King Kong reference with the rancor was cool I guess, but just felt like pandering. I will say that I would have loved to see some episodes of him training the rancor and instilling that bond we saw just forming. They really should have started airing Mando s3 with those two and put more focus on Boba. 

Speaking of Boba, does anyone else get clown suit vibes with the weirdly bright restored armor set, especially the boots? It feels more like a parade outfit than functional armor after the revamp. Wasn't really feeling the weird power pose projectile knee rocket thing they did. They're making him out to be an old man but he's got this agility activated weapon? Sure this episode showed that he's 'still got it' but this one just felt out of place. 

I can't say that bigger, badder droidekas impressed me at all. Especially when they didn't have their shields up while approaching, then activate them for dramatic effect, then immediately move with them up, the opposite of the original trope. There's no reason for the shield ever to be down if they could move with it. Also, they don't even roll, cmon now, don't give me an obvious droideka knockoff and take away the coolest part.

 Cad Bane's supposed death was a bit underwhelming in my opinion, but it is what it is. I did like the callback to clone wars, though, that's hard not to like. I think we can expect Grogu to keep growing into a jedi, just not the same kind as Yoda. I do like that the armor was chosen, it keeps the close tie to mando and provides an opportunity for Grogu to build a lightsaber while we watch. 

I can't just sit here and not call out the 'city kid' saving Krrsantan, dramatically tossing the arm aside, drawing his pistol on the three approaching Pykes, and decides that right then it's the exact perfect time to try spinning, that's a good trick right? This was honestly so bad and kind of annoys me that he survived and is sort of the head of the city kids judging from their intro scene, and the melon scene in this episode. This guy, really? 

On the note of Krrsantan, I was intrigued he got assigned the Trandoshan sector and was a little peeved all we got of that action was him getting swarmed and then his injuries after. The action we saw him in was cool because though it wasn't the most badass, he was still quite useful while heavily injured and I think that's a subtle callback to his resiliency in the arena, which made up for it, but I still feel wanting. The Trandoshans just kind of look googly eyed and not very threatening for being wookie hunters, I'd like a little more from their facial expressions I think, they don't change much and there's no real reptilian thing going on aside from their appearance. I was a little puzzled at the all of a sudden buddy buddy status between him and Boba, sure he gave him a job but could we at least see how they become friendly enough that Boba can give him a nickname? 

There's a lot that feels really shallow like the renaming of Boba's ship or Mos Pelga, to Krrsantan's nickname, or the assumed training of the rancor that would have really made this show stand out. If only they would have actually worked more on this show rather than reverted to the mandalorian for two of the seven episodes. For such a small series I think this was a very poor decision. 

Overall a decent episode all things considering, but I can't say that I loved this series as a whole.

EDIT: I really love how they made a whole scene about Boba having credits and insinuating they'd use it for muscle, only to offer only to the mandalorian then not use the funds he refused to get more muscle for the obvious upcoming fight. It made this whole episode focused on the fighting feel even more nonsensical than it does without that context. I guess maybe he'll use it to fix all the damage he caused to the city with the rancor, despite showing concern for the droids doing the same.","i swear they just downplayed boba to try and hype the other characters fennec has made him look straight up stupid multiple times over the season good to finally see the master assassin part of fennec played out rather than the parkour chase we got early on

11790,219,5,"test",0,"/r/StarWars","So now that it's done, Book of Boba Fett, as one of many lifelong Boba Fett fans...was alright.

Partly because Robert Rodriguez somehow can't convey a sense of speed during chase scenes, yet LOVES to do chase scenes, partly because it served almost as Mandalorian Season 2.5 (which isn't bad, but near a quarter of the show isn't focused on the title character).

There are some great bits. Boba turns out to be an total softy for animals, even giant monsters who you wouldn't expect to respond well to being treated like giant puppies, but it's Temuera Morrison, so they happily go along with it. The continued expansion of lore and humanization of the Tuskens and Tatooine is great, too.

The one true complaint is that this doesn't feel like it was, or rather needed, to be about Boba Fett. You could've plopped almost any character in his place, new or old, ans everything could've played out mostly the same. Because the most notoriously deadly bounty hunter now suddenly wants to run a clean local government? I mean, more power to him, but the show never makes this motivation feel natural to the character. Cad Bane has this whole bit with him in this episode about how Boba's really a killer a heart, like the show has been making this big point that he's reformed and turned to pacifiscm when he had his pet monster eat a man alive about fifteen minutes prior. I'm not saying it couldn't work, but it doesn't really work they way they've presented and written it.

What they really should've done was pull another Admiral Thrawn, and bring an Legends character or two back into proper canon. Specifically, Mirta Gev, Boba's previously unknown-to-him granddaughter, and possibly Sintas Vel, his estranged and carbonite-frozen ex-wife. 

The purpose they could've served would've been basically a transplant of their narrative roles in the books they featured in; giving Boba Fett people in his life he HAS to care about, has to be a better man for. At first its biological obligation and trying to do right by them FOR ONCE after his presence and helpfulness in their lives being intermittent to nonexistent, and eventually it starts coming from a place of love he didn't think he still had in him any longer. Introduce that element, of family that he sees as an obligating force for him to clean up his act and help provide for to make up for a lifetime of absence, and to do so in a way he thinks they would most approve of, and ALL his motivation from the Tuskens onwards makes more sense than what we got. 

I'm not saying its impossible for Bobba Fett to decide to say ""Fuck the crime establishment"" and try and build something on mutual cooperative interest and civil care, but it feels weird that he comes to that after just a few months (or however long) of living with the Tuskens, after they nearly enslaved him. A greater personal impetus for his change in goals and methods would've made it feel more authentic and given him a tad more depth as a character, AND would've also made him fighting tooth and nail for this make more sense. Because the Hutts and gangs and Syndicates aren't just threatening him; they're threatening his FAMILY. The only family he has left, that he didn't KNOW he had left prior to them appearing in his life again, and who he is determined to do right by, and do so rightly.","so now that its done book of boba fett as one of many lifelong boba fett fanswas alright

Firstly, I'm so grateful to have had such a fun show that happened to feature my favorite Star Wars character, that being Cad Bane. He's been a real treat to see and only made a good show greater.

That being said, I'm a little bummed at the potential ending he got. It's thematic, it's fitting, it's poetry (it rhymes!), but also feels like wasted opportunity. Bane is the perfect foil to Boba - a skilled Bounty Hunter who actively chooses and thrives in the role. Unlike Boba, who actively wants to better himself and others, Bane wants only to survive and get paid. Similarly, he's a dark mirror at Boba and his past life. Every time he looks Cad Bane's red eyes, he sees all the pain of his past life and the road it led him down. Bane is the perfect example of an antagonist - someone who challenges and changes their protagonist. And while I'm not saying Cad Bane needs to be the main villain (as much as I'd personally like that), he would make a wonderful addition to the Rogue's Gallery that challenges Boba on his journey. What's more, now he has further beef and wonderful plot opportunities with Boba, Fennec Shand, and Cobb Vanth! Tell me you don't want to see a final rematch between Cad and Cobb. 

Now, I know I'm just belly aching. I should just be happy that I got to see Cad Bane one more time. But I feel like Filoni knew there would be people like me out there, hence that beeping noise in his ""death scene."" He's leaving that door open for more, just in case. And to those who say I'm in denial or just hopeful, I would like to remind you that we all just watched a show about a Bounty Hunter that got eaten by the Sarlacc Pit and was assumed dead for over 20 years! Furthermore, there have been so many characters that people liked so much that even though they were clearly on death's door (Looking at you, Fennec Shand... Darth Maul... Ahsoka... PALPATINE), we got to see so much more of them in future material. 

As the jedi once said... ""no one's ever really gone.""

So...I'm sad, but I'm happy to have had what I got and am hopeful for more. And I want everyone working on Star Wars to know it. And I call on all of you who feel like me to do the same. Talk actively about how much you want to see Cad Bane again. Talk about what you want from the future and how he'd fit into it. Talk about how thrilled you were to see him in live action. And definitely buy any Merch with him in it.

If you liked seeing him as much as I did, tell everyone. And hopefully Favreau and Filoni will continue to give the fans a bit of what they want.

7920,131,5,"test",0,"/r/StarWars","Seriously, I went back and compared the Cobb Vanth standoff to the one between Bane and Boba and it’s like night and day. With ~~Bryce Dallas Howard~~ Filoni, the scene is slow and deliberate, starting with Bane approaching, then the conversation, then Bane reveals his gun and there’s almost a minute of tension before he pulls the trigger. Vanth is always framed on the left side of the screen, while Bane is always on the right, giving the viewer a sense of cohesion between the shots (this is even true with their guns; Vanth’s is on his right, our left, and Bane’s is the opposite). And the standoff tells a story. We get several mirrored shots alternating back and forth from Vanth’s and Bane’s perspectives as they size each other up. Then, the deputy comes in, and we get to see both of their reactions to him intruding. Vanth is momentarily distracted by the deputy and Bane seizes that moment to strike. And when he pulls the trigger, we see the shot from his perspective, then it switches to Vanth as he falls. Rodriguez’s standoff is so much worse. He tries to use the mirrored shots and framing thing, but the angles seem to be random, some shots just don’t keep up the motif, and he randomly zooms during some of them. Worst of all, he uses these during the conversation, not the standoff itself, if you can even call it that. There is literally no tension building whatsoever. All we get is a single, flat, wide shot of the two of them, followed by shots of the two firing FROM THE WRONG ANGLES!!! We see several quick close ups of Boba shooting, then a close of of Bane shooting, then close ups of Boba getting hit, with no shots showing whether Boba missed or hit Bane. These quick shots and the framing makes the scene frustratingly difficult to follow since the line of sight jumps all over the place.

33867,173,5,"test",1,"/r/lotr","Is it more popular? I haven’t heard anything about it recently. I watched the first season just to see what the story is like since I heard the book series was almost as popular and influential in the fantasy genre as Tolkien’s works. 

Throughout watching the series I felt something was wrong, like they were skipping entire sections so I checked online after finishing the first season and found out from many of the books’ fans that they skipped entire storylines and butchered some of the characters. That, and considering how mediocre I felt the adaptation was, I’m pretty sure I won’t be watching anymore of it anytime soon. If I do go back to the series, I’ll probably just read the books or the comic book version of it since I might not have the time or the willpower to sit down and read over ten books with hundreds of pages in each one. 

And I know many will argue that books can’t adapt everything and I agree with that sentiment. If an adaptation can remain faithful to say 80 or 90 percent of the source material while cutting out what isn’t necessary, I’d call that understandable but throughout watching the TV series I felt like they were only 50 percent faithful, maybe even less, so I can understand why WoT fans are so outraged.

Do keep in mind there are also people like me who can’t dedicate too much time to reading huge books and rely on mediums like TV and film to know the majority of the plot but if an adaptation butchers the source material, we might come out thinking the source material is actually horrible which is why I think adaptations should be as faithful as possible. A great adaptation not only keeps most of the story intact but also elevates it.

Lastly, going back to the topic of popularity, has there been a noticeable uptick in the popularity of WoT? Like I said at the beginning, there hasn’t been that much talk regarding the series since the first season ended. It’s certainly nothing like Game of Thrones or even the Witcher after its first season released where there was so much buzz and so much enthusiasm surrounding the series that you keep hearing about it from time to time. I remember my friends bringing both series up from time to time while those series were airing but not once have they brought up WoT whenever we hanged out or talked. I feel like this is going to end up like Netflix’s Cowboy Bebop series where there was some hype at the start but it failed later on due to a combination of fan backlash, and bad reviews from critics. I even remember it getting high numbers of views early on in its first episodes but the number of views dropped significantly in later episodes. I feel like WoT might be facing the same problem unless they course correct and make the series more faithful to the books.","is it more popular i havent heard anything about it recently i watched the first season just to see what the story is like since i heard the book series was almost as popular and influential in the fantasy genre as tolkiens works

Even movie Boromir managed to resist visible temptation twice on screen before he succumbed at the end of the movie. Once when he held it in his own hand.

Watching the robots chase a large group of people in a straight line and not hit a single one of them because it's aiming behind their feet the whole time was goddamn painful. That and it waiting until they all bailed on the speeder to fire the single shot that made it blow up. And the Pykes waiting until like 30 of their men were killed to bring out said robots instead of leading with them. And Boba not using the Rancor at his disposal at the outset while complaining about not having enough resources. 

The whole thing was so needlessly drawn out and they padded all of that time with nonsense that made everyone and everything in it seem dumb. I'm so disappointed that this episode is what followed 5 and 6. Fennec's weird cleanup scene being inserted at the end like they forgot to tie up the leaders loose end was so sloppy that I almost thought she was acting against Boba's wishes. 

I desperately hope we either don't get a Season 2 or that they don't use the same showrunners/writers/directors for it. The only good parts of this season had nothing to do with the primary plot. BDH absolutely killed it in Episode 5 and while I'm somewhat conflicted with Luke's choice for Grogu in 6, it was otherwise well paced and written, though I thought that payoff wouldn't come until Mando Season 3; having it happen in the next episode felt a bit rushed. 

Overall for the series, maybe a 3/10 -- if anything, it made me miss looking forward to the films, weirdly enough, since Mando and various spinoffs alone aren't hitting quite the same way, even when they're good.

It's hard to describe, but sth about the mix of my favorite genre and this slavic vibe warmed my heart somehow. Also it made the books more unique in comparison to more America style fantasy series (I like those, but if it's all we're ever getting, it starts to be a bit boring).

I also like the genre for many reasons, one of them is worldbuilding, the characteristics of fantasy races and human race distribution are parts of worldbuilding too. In fantasy inspired by African myths I would've preferred black actors playing all roles unless 1) lore describes fantasy creature as pale, so it should be presented as pale 2) plot says the character is a person of different skin color, that came from afar. In Tolkien's works I'd love representation in the form of a season focused on Harad, or integrating a Haradrim character into the story.","well im slavic for one and like to see my culture integrated with this fantasy world its hard to describe but sth about the mix of my favorite genre and this slavic vibe warmed my heart somehow also it made the books more unique in comparison to more america style fantasy series i like those but if its all were ever getting it starts to be a bit boring

Making dwarves black disconnects them from the myths they are inspired from. You choose to ignore skin colour by your standard, for others skin colour is as important as other physical features.

>You can make the female dwarves beardless. I’d have preferred to see them with beards, but are you going to tell me the narrative of the LotR hinges on the facial hair of women dwarves who don’t even feature in the story? Really?

Nice strawman. I rejected your importance of narrative. There is no need for narrative around looks of beings. Dwarves' height or bulkiness is not important to the story narrative. Elves having pointy ears is not important to the story either. Narrative is irrelevant.

And your argument goes both ways. How blackwashing dwarves and elves is important to the story? It is not.

&#x200B;

>Imagine a world where women have long beards as an immutable characteristic, were systemically enslaved, tortured, raped, slaughtered without consequence, and only recently received legal (not actual economic or social) parity with their beardless sisters, and all of this horribleness “dictated” by the presence of absence of that beard. I don’t give a fuck if stories that didn’t originally feature them, produced by the dominant beardless peoples, originally had the bearded women or not. Put the bearded women in and stop acting like a child.

Grow. Up.

Imagined. If it goes against, established aesthetics of the show, they shouldn't be there. It's not a big deal, there are plenty of other opportunities. Some works require diverse cast: GoT, Expanse. Some works require black only cast: Empire, Black Panther. Some works require white only cast: Lotr, Vikings.

And don't try to use the oppressed tactic on me. I am pro equality, not equity. It means that I will treat those bearded women to the same standard as everyone else. If a story has no suitable role for them, I will not give them special privilege by creating one. And when there is a movie solely dedicated to bearded women, I will not make demands or criticize that movie for the lack of representation of non-bearded women.

Also, don't be ageist/heightist. if I grow up anymore, I will make a hole in the ceiling. On serious note, if you want conversation to stay civil, don't act condescending because someone doesn't agree with your views, we are all adults here.","you could make the dwarves taller than men it would disconnect them from the myths that inspired them

They actually released a series recently that caused some uproar, where they cast a Black actress to portray Anne Boleyn. I can understand how certain fictional characters can be portrayed by non white actors, but to portray a well known, historic, British figure as Black, is just ridiculous. Anne Boleyn was categorically White. The King of England (Henry) would never have married a Black woman. That would never have been allowed even if he wanted to, and going by our knowledge of Henry and those times, that wouldn’t have been likely.

Her Son nearly had her committed as insane amongst a load of other threats just so she wouldn’t maintain a friendship with an Indian man. I feel like we are entitled to have our own history and culture that shouldn’t have to be diversified.

When you make major changes for diversity’s sake, you could at the very least pay attention to small yet important details. It’s like if the american soldiers in private Ryan were waving the Canadian flag. 

It isn’t just Galadriel. Tolkien was extremely detailed in his work. With a whole page dedicated to describing how eldrond and Arwen look. Both of which had long black hair. Elrond is blonde now for some reason. And the actor looks funky as all hell. 

Isildur’s sister never existed. Tolkien was extremely detailed when it came to family lines. Isildur’s sister shouldn’t be there, as well as a whole other host of characters. 

The hobbits really shouldn’t be as active as they are said to be in this new show. Keep in mind hobbits we’re mostly unknown to middle earth. And they didn’t often leave the shire. Bar tooks and even they left only on occasion.

You have an issue too many people suffer from nowadays. You refuse to look into the depth of the opposition’s argument and simply straw man it as racist. The argument against forced diversity I would say is actually an anti-racist one.

So just like how there being a bunch of random white people in Wakanda doesn’t make sense, it doesn’t make sense for middle earth either. If you wanted a majority non white cast the show should have set it in Rhun or Southern Harad. And better yet then they wouldn’t have to worry about details in regards to established characters. They could make entirely new ones while still being cannon to the lore. And they can even include the blue wizards.

Later, Yoda lights the tree on fire and we get that awesome “but the sacred texts!” line which sort of reinforced that idea.

Ah, but no....the call of the cash is far more alluring than any sort of moral or academic integrity.  So we'll just claim that we can do whatever we want to Tolkien anyway, because he's dead.

I wasn't impressed by Rodriguez's first showing when he directed ""The Tragedy"" back in season 2 of the Mandalorian, but somehow people seemed to love that episode and even had it as their favorite. When I heard Rodriguez was going to be involved in this I was not thrilled. For the most part I'd say my worries were justified. This show had some of the best Star Wars I've ever seen, but unfortunate none of those moments had anything to do with Boba Fett. I think this show could have done a thousand times better in different hands. As a whole this show fails. And the worst of it seems to be due to Rodriguez's style. I really hope that he doesn’t get to direct any future star wars and that the Mandalorian can be untouched by the unfortunate mistakes of this show. It is a shame that Din and Grogus meaningful reunion had to be stuffed into this show. This should have only been about Boba and it should have been directed my someone else. It also would have helped if the story was more interesting. Watching Boba form a relationship with the Tuskens was the most solid part of this show. Everything else with Boba was unfortunately very slow and uninteresting. The Pykes were not intimidating enough and not nearly as cool as Cad Bane who was shoved into the last two episodes of the show. The best way to describe this show is to say that it is a mess. This show hurt Boba Fett more then it helped him and that's probably what makes it even harder for me to swallow. Everything with Boba as a whole is unfortunately 4/10 stars for me. The episodes where we focused only on Din and Grogu are easily an 8/10, but the fact that they are in this show makes them weaker in my eyes. I don't think I'll be excited to watch this show again except for certain episodes.

Galadriel fighting at Alqualondë: ""Galadriel’s quarrel with the sons of Fëanor at sack of Alqualondë. How she fought…"" - Nature of Middle-earth  

Note that the event of fighting at Alqualonde itself is described as a quarrel by Tolkien: ""...Thrice the folk of Feanor were driven back, and many were slain upon either side; but the vanguard of the Noldor were succoured by Fingon with the foremost people of Fingolfin. These coming up found a battle joined and their own kin falling, and they rushed in ere they knew rightly the cause of the quarrel: some deemed indeed that the Teleri had sought to waylay the march of the Noldor, at the bidding of the Valar."" 

 There's a marginal note against this passage in Morgoth's Ring: ""$149 Marginal note against the passage describing the involvement of the second host in the fighting: 'Finrod and Galadriel (whose husband was of the Teleri) fought against Feanor in defence of Alqualonde.' ""  

And in Shibboleth: ""she fought fiercely against Feanor in defence of her mother's kin.""  - Peoples of Middle-earth 

Her fight in the Second and Third Kinslayings is not specifically specified. The only guy from Doriath who is specifically said to have fought in Ruin of Doriath is Dior. But that doesn't mean others just watched, anyone who could fought must've fought. Thranduil, Galadriel, Celeborn, Amdir, anyone who was capable of fighting must've fought in defence of Doriath and Sirion. (These were all present at these events) 

Galadriel helcaraxe: ""Her pride was unwilling to return, a defeated suppliant for
pardon; but now she burned with desire to follow Fëanor with her
anger to whatever lands he might come, and to thwart him in all ways
that she could."" - Peoples of Middle-earth, Shibboleth of Feanor 

""Therefore led by Fingolfin
 and his sons, and by Inglor and Galadriel the valiant and fair,
 they dared to pass into the untrodden North, and finding no
 other way they endured at last the terror of the Helkaraxe and
 the cruel hills of ice. Few of the deeds of the Noldor thereafter
 surpassed that desperate crossing in hardihood or in woe. Many
 there perished, and it was with a lessened host that Fingolfin set
 foot at last upon the Northlands of Endar. Little love for Feanor

 their trumpets in Middle-earth at the first rising of the Moon."" - Morgoth's Ring, Annals of Aman

Galadriel x Annatar: "" In Eregion Sauron posed as an emissary of the Valar, sent by them to
Middle-earth (‘thus anticipating the Istari’) or ordered by them to remain
there to give aid to the Elves. He perceived at once that Galadriel would be
his chief adversary and obstacle, and he endeavoured therefore to placate
her, bearing her scorn with outward patience and courtesy."" - Unfinished Tales, History of Galadriel and Celeborn 

""Galadriel was not deceived, saying that this Aulendil was not in the train of Aulë in Valinor"" - ibid

""Sauron visited the Elves; but was rejected by Gil-galad in S.A. 1200. He

dissembles his wrath, and gets round Celebrimbor."" - Nature of Middle-earth, Galadriel and Celeborn 

Galadriel saving Eregion's survivors: well, this one has many versions and aspects. To quote some of them:  ""Celeborn and Galadriel take part in .... [Eregion's] defence against Sauron."" “Galadriel and Celeborn, and their followers, who after the destruction of Eregion passed through Moria” “Galadriel and Celeborn only retreated thither [to Lorien] after the downfall of Eregion."" “After the Fall of Eregion... They had passed through Moria with considerable following of Noldorin Exiles and dwelt for many years in Lorien”

Above quotes are from Parma Eldalamberon 17 and Nature of Middle-earth.

Galadriel vs Sauron: this is too long. It's a wall of text. It's from Unfinished Tales book, Cirion and Eorl chapter. Basically, in short, Sauron creates shadows and dark clouds of terror and sends them over the host of Eorl, they freak out and want to flee and change their path (which would've resulted in the destruction of Gondor if they had changed their path and if they had not arrived in time to the battle), but Galadriel casts a white mist and drives back the glooms of Dol Guldur and Sauron couldn't even resist and successfully fight back, then Galadriel covers the entire 7500 Eorlingas with her mist and heals them and speeds them up and hides them from both eyes and ears. 

Galadriel vs Dol Guldur:

""Three times Lórien had been assailed from Dol Guldur, but besides the valour of the elven people of that land, the power that dwelt there was too great for any to overcome, unless Sauron had come there himself. Though grievous harm was done to the fair woods on the borders, the assaults were driven back; and when the Shadow passed, Celeborn came forth and led the host of Lórien over Anduin in many boats. They took Dol Guldur, and Galadriel threw down its walls and laid bare its pits, and the forest was cleansed."" - The Return of the King, LoTR Appendix B, The Tale of Years: The Third Age","galadriel barely exists in the published silmarillion the galadriel of the published silmarillion is all from her  versions these are from later writings

Now, in most cases, ""the later the better"" is the approache I (and many Tolkien experts) take.

However, in this case, not only does it contradict a general statement (all Dwarven women have beards) but the same text mentions that Elves could not grow beards under any circumstances, which contradicts a specific character description we have in the published texts of Círdan and Mahtan - both things (Dwarven women have beards and Círdan having a beard) are things that were published by Tolkien himself in The Lord of The Rings...

So it is indeed a problematic case, IMO. (Unlike other things such as Gil-galad's origin, which is not mentioned in anything JRRT published himself, but only by his son, later on).

Areas of Harad were part of the kingdom of Gondor, the Numenorians had cities there. Easterlings are also supposed to have traded/raided the lands of men too.

I want to point out what I feel is an important distinction here.

It's okay for film and television studios to want to make a profit on their products.

That's literally their business model: they create a product, and if the product is popular they get to sell tickets/ads/subscriptions.  

**That's not greed.  That's their job.**

And if they want to be good at their job, they have to minimize costs while maximizing revenues. 

And that's where studio executives are wildly different from actors, directors, and screenwriters: an executive is a *businessman*, not an artist.

Studios don't care about innovative ideas or compelling characters...at least, not beyond ""people seem to like these things, so I want to sell them some.""

Studios want a safe bet.  A sure thing.  A winning formula.  They want a new version of the latest popular thing.

*Game of Thrones* convinced studios that fantasy was a safe bet.

So now we're seeing a bunch of new fantasy being released.  And many or most of them are...formulaic.  

Nobody wants a series they love to be reduced to a generic formula.  A lot of *Witcher* fans are not happy with the Netflix series.  A lot of *Wheel of Time* fans are not happy with the Amazon series.  

Tolkien fans have good reason to be worried about the Amazon series.

The original group is offended by these accusations and the suggestion that their opinion doesn’t matter as a result, so they dig in even further as they’re *certain* it’s going to be the worst show of all time. The second group responds by stubbornly digging in more as well, as they’re *certain* it’s going to be the greatest show of all time.

Like I said, I have concerns. I’m seeing what I believe are red flags based on our current social and cultural context in 2022. I don’t think it’s necessarily fair to compare this with 2001, as the context in each situation is entirely different. I am more than willing to be proven wrong, but what I’m saying is that I don’t currently expect to be. That being said, I don’t want to be included in any group of people who think it’s a certainty at this point in either direction. You’re wrong if you’re convinced it’s impossible it will be good, and you’re wrong if you’re convinced it’s impossible it will be bad. I just don’t want what I feel are genuine concerns to be so automatically dismissed by people because they’re on polarization auto-pilot.","im not confident it will be good but i admit ill have no idea until i see it i think the thing that bothers me the most is the sense of unnecessary escalation there seems to have been one group of people raise some i believe legitimate concerns another group overreacts to this by dismissing those concerns entirely citing what is assumed to be racism and sexism the original group is offended by these accusations and the suggestion that their opinion doesnt matter as a result so they dig in even further as theyre certain its going to be the worst show of all time the second group responds by stubbornly digging in more as well as theyre certain its going to be the greatest show of all time

14742,119,5,"test",0,"/r/StarWars","I think there’s loads of character development, although as you say some of it is not very detailed. 

Boba Fett is a changed man. His experience at the hands of the Tuskens was initially humiliating, but he came to respect them and they him. Good concept, and the fact that they are killed is then what drives forward his next actions.

The only major flaw I personally saw in his actions was the way he gunned the biker gang down from behind. While I get that he wants revenge, it feels pretty low (and against his new character) to do it that way. 

Secondly, if I’ve understood it properly, part of Boba’s story is about setting up the Mandalorian’s motivations. Mando’s story in this series mirrors that of Boba: having completed his quest he returns to bounty hunting as the only way of life he knows. Manages to find his tribe, but is then outcast for not following their rules. The starfighter signifies the transformation of Din from a bounty hunter into a Jedi-like heroic figure. Ironically, he’s far more at home with the reformed Boba than he is with his own tribe of Mandalorians. He also now has an example of someone who has gone from being a bounty hunter to a leader and shares a similar moral compass.

Finally, Luke Skywalker. At the end of episode 6 he tells Grogu that for him, a few years will be a lifetime for others. I am fairly sure that he was telling Grogu to follow his heart and go and spend time with Din. Din will surely die and Grogu will go on living for another 700+ years. There’s plenty of time for him to become a Jedi, but it won’t be as Luke’s student. I don’t think that’s remotely out of character for Luke and seemed like an elegant way of getting Grogu back to Din without some sort of epic failure in training or expelling Grogu because he’s eaten all the frogs or something…","i think theres loads of character development although as you say some of it is not very detailed

Strawman nonsense. Wanting the story to be consistent with the lore is not equivalent to believing in racial supremacy.

Nobody said he was. He wouldn't need to be a racial purist to think that a cast that looks like it comes from a modern multicultural City would be out of place In a story based on European history and myth. It makes zero sense and breaks immersion. Tolkiens mythology contains races that are non-white(Haradrim, Easterlings) and nobody would care if they were represented in the film. Putting a random black elf and dwarf without explanation makes no sense.

39284,127,5,"test",1,"/r/lotr","Please don't get me wrong. I agree that there shouldn't be this kind of backlash for something that's fantasy. Hardcore fans will be mad but not for racist reasons. Other fairweather fans (or not even fans) who are also racist are pissed because well, you know. 

Miles Morales is different than what you're speaking of because it's a brand new regular kid who happens to be half black and half Puerto Rican. They didn't make Peter Parker change races. Not that that should even matter. That's a whole new character who took the mantle after the original Spider-Man died. Just like anyone pissed off that Captain America is black now can fuck off. It can be a (I kinda hate I'm using this term) slippery slope. Trans dwarves...Actually, that'd be pretty easy to implement. But the point being, it's...well, not as immersive as a fan.

*What was done to it?*

I went through the shots individually and redid the colours, generally speaking toned it down a bit and from memory shifted the look more towards the PJ trilogy, though I didn't reference it or make any direct comparisons. Some shots needed more than the others.

I added a 35mm Film Grain to the footage, to try and counter the digital look a bit, and bring a bit more ""real"" feel to it. Nothing too fancy, but still.

I recreated the music entirely. The goal was to make the music be reminiscent of the music of the films, but still stay in a trailer friendly territory. I hoped to get a different feel to the teaser with it, and not add any childlike tone to it. As said, I didn't do a score study or spend a ton of time on this, and I'm certainly no Howard Shore, but I think it's just enough to at least give a different feel to the teaser. 

&#x200B;

*I also want to add a sort of a disclaimer*

I don't pretend I can do it better than the people behind the original teaser. The teaser is obviously a well made product and whatever decisions have been made for its tone I'm sure are decisions I have no clue about. I'd guess most would prefer that original style anyway. I simply wanted to try what it would look and feel like with an approach closer to my own nostalgic memories. Whether I did a decent job of that or not is a different matter, but to me it gave a glimpse of it. 

I'd also like to mention that this is not a critical take on the music itself as well as the composer. They have worked to a brief, notes, requests from the trailer house, and the trailer house people have done the same with the studio, and they all have limited control over the direction or tone of the music. For what it is trying to do, the original trailer cue is amazingly well done and produced and worthy of praise. As above, I simply wanted to try something different and thought there'd be others here who might want to have a look as well.","this was made just for the fun of it i just wanted to see what the teaser would look and feel like with a less fantastical and colourful grade and slightly more shore inspired music now im not a colourist neither am i howard shore i didnt study the colour palettes of middle earth or do a score study on the shore score and for this to have been done properly i would have liked to spent a lot more time than i did but i think overall it at least offers a different look at the teaser if nothing else it satisfied my own will to see the teaser with a different approach and i thought there might be others who might be curious too even if its not a masterpiece you can consider it a work of fandom i suppose

id also like to mention that this is not a critical take on the music itself as well as the composer they have worked to a brief notes requests from the trailer house and the trailer house people have done the same with the studio and they all have limited control over the direction or tone of the music for what it is trying to do the original trailer cue is amazingly well done and produced and worthy of praise as above i simply wanted to try something different and thought thered be others here who might want to have a look as well"
14156,138,5,"test",0,"/r/StarWars","okay, i believe i have some thoughts about the finale now, for one i really do want to give that episode a thumbs up but i just... can't. 

Well let's start off with the bad. 

Please for the love of god please just delete the modder gang, they were very -B movie-esque and shouldn't have gotten that much screentime action. Don't even get me started with their dialogue. (lmao) Okay secondly, they should've just killed off the twi'lek negotiator guy, i promise you most people would've been okay/happy about that. the dude just sucked the life out of the moment repeatedly in the series and was just flat out annoying. Also god, that ending with the Mandalorian felt super jarring and unsatisfying, even the post credits scene with the bacta tank felt like a deleted scene and practically left no continuation with any of the main characters. The only hints we got with Mandalorian Season 3 was for him to go back to the planet of Mandalore to restore his honor in an earlier episode. Outside of 3 episodes, yeah i'm not gonna watch this series again anytime soon.

Now let's get into the good! 

I saw someone earlier in this thread say they killed off cad bane too quickly. I very much disagree with that, I get that people think he's one of the more interesting star wars characters, but he's been around forever since the Clone Wars and has extensive history. Boba in the show was even like ""bro, you too old for this shit"". It felt super gratifying for Boba to kill him finally. especially, given the context where he's killed many clones that look exactly like him. That was one of the few things done right. Also that tandom of Fett and Djarin, and the riding of the rancor, that was **HEAT**. What really gets me excited about the future with Grogu is that he chose the beskar chain mail and be a foundling in that episode, which leaves me to believe.... 

(drum roll please)

... he's gonna be the *2nd* Mandalorian-Jedi after Tarre Vizla. I don't think there's any doubt in my mind about that. They don't just lightly hint at a lightsaber *and* beskar armor at the same time to not be used. It adds up too perfectly.

 Again, I really do want to like the finale and not come off as a hater, but come on, it was definitely below average. it's okay to admit that and be honest.","okay i believe i have some thoughts about the finale now for one i really do want to give that episode a thumbs up but i just cant

Then he wrote an essay about how the Elves invented and used a decimal system based on their fingers in a similar, though not exactly identical system we use today.

40281,151,5,"test",1,"/r/lotr","I agree. There are valid criticisms of the teaser. 

For instance, when Galadriel was climbing the wall, it truly looked inauthentic. I was promptly schooled that the shot was actually practical, but that doesn’t mean anything to me. The end result was something that looked straight out of a video game and as fake as one. If you’re using practical effects and it still comes out looking shitty, maybe rethink the camera you are filming with, or the lighting, or something. People can only judge what you give them and despite it being practical, it easily looks like bad CGI. That shot and the troll stood out. You can’t get upset at people expecting more when you were flaunting your $1 billion dollar budget. House of the Dragon had a tenth of that in budget and still had better visuals in its teaser. 

In my opinion, people complaining about the lack of beards, Celebrimbor being old, short-haired elves, and Elrond’s Elvis Presley blowout are being a little nit picky. If the show is good, I really don’t think those things are going to ruin it, but this is all people have, so they can complain about it. 

As more is revealed about the story itself, there are other things to be critical of like the timeline compression, Meteor Man/Asteroidude, Galadriel’s revenge, Galadriel’s trip to Numenor with a random human who touches her hair and apparently needs to see the pointy ears in order to understand someone is an elf, hobbits being in this at all, Sauron attacking the hobbits, too many plot threads, strange rumors about Galadriel’s brother being a father of orcs, etc. 

But you can’t really give your final opinion on any of that until you see it play out onscreen.

But I have yet to see any posts here that say ""oh I saw Cordova (eg) in something else and he was really awful, I'm really disappointed with this casting choice.""

>	Do you think European can be casted in non European mythological fantasy? Like atla. I am just wondering if people are “double standard” or “I don’t see race”.

""I don't see race"" is just another way of saying ""I perceive everyone to be/treat everyone as though they were white"", which amounts to cultural erasure. It's a highly problematic attitude, honestly.

If the movie is being made for an audience in, say, America, you cannot recast white people in traditionally non-white character roles without having a really good justification. But if we were talking about, say, a movie about ancient Chinese mythology (like the Monkey King, for instance), and the movie was being made in China, and they chose to cast a white actor to play what would otherwise be a Chinese character — that's fine.

The context matters. White people, in general, have all the political power in America and most of what we call the West, so it's not okay for them to go taking roles that belong to people from other ethnic groups. But it's okay to take roles from white people and give them to those groups for the same reason — the power imbalance. It's like the cast of Hamilton. Those characters ""should"" all be white, because in real life those people were white, but they're played by non-white people and it's totally fine. But if you wanted to cast Tom Cruise to play, like, Shaq in a movie about basketball, there'd be a problem.","if someone disagree with the casting but still think that people should not be discriminated based on race in qualificationbased employment and education would you consider them racist

They just handled it like game of thrones handled their ending (ie. very badly).

1. Palpatine’s master learnt how to manipulate midiclorians to create life and to save others from dying, but not himself.
2. He taught Palpatine to do the same, but couldn’t figure out saving himself from dying, thus was killed.
3. Palpatine clearly sees this as a weakness, despite midiclorian manipulation to syphon the force out of Padme and into his implied midiclorian conceived son, Anakin, to save his life (Rey’s mother/father was probably Sheev’s first attempt at producing an “offspring” which could serve as a powerful, trainable, highly force-sensitive apprentice, while Anakin was his second).
4. One of the first things we find out Palpatine has done is create clones for a clone army.
5. An excellent demonstration and testing phase for the creation of an identical copy of oneself.
6. Do you really think Palpatine would order the new empire to destroy the cloning facilities on Kamino without keeping the proven successful technologies to himself to experiment on a method of sending his force spirit into an empty clone as a method of saving himself from dying? The one thing his master could not do?

The simple problem was that they didn’t have Snoke die on Starkiller Base when it blew up, and again in the Supremacy, and then again in the Death Star wreckage, setting up the idea of resurrection-by-cloning. Each iteration could be more and more humanlike/palpatinelike.

Much like Game of Thrones’ lack of setup for its ending >!(ie.

The trilogy could end with them agreeing to disagree and finally bringing a true balance of light and dark to the galaxy.
