4780,58,3,"train",0,"/r/StarWars","> Boba Fett's armor was durasteel until it was retconned which is why my headcanon is that it's made of an alloy of beskar and durasteel.

It’s shown to have the same blaster-resistant qualities as Din’s armor has (both in the most recent episode as well as a flashback with Cobb Vanth wearing it). Additionally, Boba goes out of his way to mention that it would have survived in the acidic stomach of the Sarlacc because of it being Beskar when searching for it in the flashback during episode 4 of BoBF.

I think it’s safe to say Boba’s armor is a high quality as Din’s is. Din’s is just thicker and he wears additional pieces to cover more of his body. It seems that Mandalorian armor is either entirely of some lesser material like durasteel (Din in his initial appearance) or it’s bonafide Beskar; there’s nothing in canon to suggest an in-between exists.","boba fetts armor was durasteel until it was retconned which is why my headcanon is that its made of an alloy of beskar and durasteel

It's only a thing in that the descendents of slavery in your country don't know their origins because they were abducted against their will. In my country people know exactly where they've come from, they came willingly and they take pride in their actual identities be they Gambian or Jamaican or Pakistani. Black and white identities are an artificial construct almost entirely used to perpetuate an us vs them mentality, it's an ideology of struggle and opposition which makes it ideological poison, and it's being imported here, just like every other aspect of creeping Americanisation. We have people that genuinely believe that the UK police are murdering black people on an industrial scale - they're not,  they're not murdering ANYBODY, yet that belief is creeping in. Between 2020 to 2021 they shot 6 people, 3 in the middle of an active terror attack.

I see you've ignored everything that's been said to reiterate the same tired old 'but there's dragons' point. Fantasy doesn't mean anything is possible, it means it follows it's own logic. 

Highly diverse low technology settings are always jarring since we know that all travel is highly difficult and dangerous therefore different ethnic groups would move in mass migrations based off environmental pressure rather than traversing the world for a whim, so you wouldn't see one or two individuals within a society being noticeably distinct from the general population, they'd be a member of a recognised tribe, and if they came as individuals they'd be integrated into the genepool in 3 or fewer generations. Logic dictates that it doesn't make sense to have token minorities scattered throughout the world, it raises a lot of questions as to how they got there and why there aren't more people like them. Every character like this needs a distinct story to explain their presence, just like we need to explain why William Adams was in Ieyasu Tokugawa's Court or Yasuke was in Oda Nobunagas. It was exceptional for Marco Polo to traverse the entirety of the Silk Road, every trader involved would only do a small stretch of it to minimise the risks and because they didn't want to leave their homeland.

But returning to our point about it being fantasy, you're right, there could be alternate explanations, maybe these characters travelled the world on the back of giant eagles. Maybe melanin falls in showers from the sky. Maybe genetics don't exist and people just roll their characteristics like a slot machine. In any case an explanation is expected. Modern societies are more diverse but that's hardly surprising when you can get on a plane and be on a different continent in 8 hours.

There are monsters in Beowulf. It's still MY shit. Why do you (Americans) need to get into my culture? You've got your own. You can appreciate mine without commodifying it.

That you should be able to see a character at a distance, or in silhouette, and still know who that person is. The same applies to group recognition. Costumes and wigs aren't just about making the character look good, it can tell us so much more than that, immediately and without having to say or explain anything. You know someone's an elf at a glance because their look draws from the elves' theme. You can say that guy is from Gondor but this guy is from Rohan because they have different looks.

The pikes don't really seem that much of a threat since the only reinforcements Boba received were a few civilians from Freetown, and his Rancor.

Cad Bane not joining the battle until after the Pikes are on the verge of defeat is dumb, though he was badass.

Why couldn't Fennec just take out the leader of the Pikes like 4 episodes ago? 

Bane's death was okay - although I feel like they should have had flashbacks to their time in the clone wars. 

Where is the female warrior Tusken? Is she dead? Her body wasn't at the camp, so where is she?

Cobb Vanth being alive didn't need its own end credit scene, people pretty much knew this already.

The action scene with Mando and Boba was awesome, but the extended shootout was terrible, awful awful directing.

I can't believe the Pikes didn't hire any more muscle, like no Bossk for instance?

Last episode felt rushed, kinda reminded me of the Battle of Winterfell, this big bad threat was dealt with in the space of 1 episode.

XXL Droidekas being op was dragged out for far too long.

Grogu should not have shown up in this episode at all. Should have been saved for S3 Mando.

Combine that with Rey having built her own double lightsaber, Finn having been taught a bit how to be a jedi (but weaker than Rey).

One thing you may be forgetting is that the ring grew in its power when it was closer to mount doom and being destroyed, so much so that it’s power was impossible to resist at that point for anyone, as stated by Tolkien in letter 246:

""At the last moment the pressure of the Ring would reach its maximum -- impossible, I should have said, for any one to resist, certainly after long possession, months of increasing torment, and when starved and exhausted.”

They would have to be lowly elves to qualify - the closest being Mirkwood because they are a bunch of spider tolerating, drunk fae (except Tolkien never treats them this way - they are still treated like Elrond even when story says otherwise)

Anyways Dwarves appear valid. The genetics argument is mostly conjecture, relying on those family trees and age/location constraints. On the cave appearance - or more evolutionary adaptations - none of Tolkien's lore qualifies. He's not describing morlocks, falmer, etc for dwarves - that's his Gollum. That deep cave approach may not be applicable, even if we did apply a science approach - since they're more of a creature that can go between caves and back in (like a bat or badger.)

Anyways, the historical principle of brown little people is rooted in mythology and fairytales. Hobbits should qualify but Hobbits are complicated because Tolkien writes them as relatively modern countryside, ideal English. Tolkien repeatedly rejected the creature perception on them - the fat rabbit, faerie view. (And this perception is actually quite English - more Old English than Tolkien.) But Tolkien breaks so many of his rules to get the Hobbits there as a modern man figure (against medieval Rohirrim). They are somewhat akin to the schoolchildren in Lion Witch and the Wardrobe - out of place English people in a fantasy land. If they were brown they would be brown against the measure of ideal, countryside English - which is more complicated, and this argument is not supported by the historical English ethnocentrism.

All arguments on what men and hobbits should be is going to run into an English white monoculture, historically. Except for the lands where he explicitly has different skin tones, and the possibility of rare individuals (following history). But again hobbits are complicated because they are more modern, and more ""ideal"" English - so that could translate into a modern argument about what that is.

&#x200B;

1: Dwarves having bearded females that are indistinguishable from the males to outsiders is a fairly well known aspect of Tolkien lore. Beardless elves isn't and its not even strongly supported in cannon. Cirdan had a beard, Mahtan had a beard. Bearded elves Is a lot less controversial a change for an adaptation to make than bearded dwarves.

2: Numenoreans are described as having beards several times. people claiming they dont have beards are creatively cherry-picking. The statue of a Numenorean king at the crossroads in Ithilien ""The eyes were hollow and the carven beard was broken, but about the high stern forehead there was a coronal of silver and gold"".

3: the only reference to beardlessness in Numenoreans is from Unfinished Tales, which is not cannon and is directly contradicted by canonical work.

4: Even if you want to stand on the Unfinished Tales reference about  Numenoreans not having beards Aragorn is the 64th descendant of Elros who himself wasn't a full blood elf. If Numenoreans like that depicted on the statue  at the crossroads could have developed beards then the modern Dúnedain with their mixed blood should be able to grow beards too.

TLDR: There is no wiggle room in the lore for non bearded dwarves while there is a strong case to be made for bearded Numenoreans.

So no, its not the same size issue at all.","theres multiple reasons why non beaded female dwarves is a bigger issue than aragorn and other numenoreans having beards its an apple to oranges comparison

Spoilers ahead for anyone who's not seen the show or read the books.

You have been warned.

Right so.

The big ones are:

- The whole Eye of the World scene is fucked. Only Rand and Moiraine go there. She masks the bond so he can't follow and Lan takes this ultra calm and just sits in Fal Dara. Until Nynaeve says Moiraine has a ""tell"" and she can track her where Lan can't...

- There's no Saidin or Saidar. Just the power.

- Rand's big finale is stolen and given to the female characters. He only defeats Ishamael (they swapped him in for the other 2) when a vision of Egwene reminds him how powerful and amazing she is and how he has to do it for her. And the bit where he appears at Tarwin's Gap and saves the Sheinaran army, inspiring many to become fanatics like Masema later on, doesn't happen at all.

- Tarwin's Gap. Instead of the above we get Agelmar's sister (Morgase-level weak), Egwene, Nynaeve and 2 wilders linking and defeating the trollocs. Its not explained how any know to link. All bar Egwene burn out. Except they take burn out literally and they are scorched to death. Except Egwene, who then simply cures death and brings Nynaeve back.

- Agelmar meanwhile dies at the Gap. Except rather than the open battle they put up a little wall to try and copy The Wall from GoT but do it terribly. No loss him dying since they portray him as a sneery misogynist rather than the soft-spoken poet who loves Aes Sedai for the help they've given Sheinar in the past.

- Sheinar's army is literally 30 lads on horses. When leading them to the wall Agelmar gives an attempt at a big LOTR speech (that fails miserably) and then they break into a charge. Only to enter the stables.... It was jarring as fuck. Camera cuts away and we come back many scenes later to see that it's dark and all the cavalry are manning the walls. Including Great Captain Agelmar. Who fights and dies in the most important battle of the age so far as a mere crossbowman on the wall.

- Speaking of the wall. Trollocs can now swarm and pile up exactly like the zombies in World War Z and that's how they deal with walls.

- The Horn of Valere was hidden under Agelmar's throne and all his guards knew it.

- Fain knew it too and was able to walk into Fal Dara, take it and walk out again with no hassle. Accompanied by Fades. Perrin, who's done nothing all season, merely watches. Loial gets stabbed by the Shadar Logoth dagger so should be dead but we've already been told he lives by the show runner, such was the outcry.

- Min is a world weary, cynical bar tender in Fal Dara who looks 48 and has zero chemistry with Rand.

- Big montage of how it's the women of the city who will protect Fal Dara and not its soldiers.

- The Seanchan come to an empty coast with huge mountains running right up to the beach. They unleash a massive tsunami to kill a lone child there. In reality that tsunami would've broke against the mountains and surged back out, destroying the Seanchan fleet.

- Suldam now have gimp ball-gags for some reason.

- Seanchan look like Stargate cosplayers.

- Stupid Rand, Perrin, Egwene love triangle that shows up out of nowhere.

- Rand finally calls Egwene on her nonsense in his only good scene. Minutes later he's back apologising telling her she's amazing and he was a fool.

- Dragon reveal is painfully shite.

- Despite that it seems like they might try and be ultra-inclusive and go for a ""many-headed Dragon"" so the girls get to have a go.

- Lan teleports in one scene due to editing that's so hilariously bad it should win a Razzie.

- Lan fucks Nynaeve and then kicks her to the curb the next morning like it was nothing. She takes this calmly.

- Mat chickens out of going into the Ways and lets them go alone. He pops up again at Shadar Logoth looking like a Sith while the Battle of Tarwin's Gap rages.

- The Ways are shit and can only be opened with the Power. Just to make the girls more special. Except in the next episode they forget that and have Fain able to make his way through.

- They show Lews Terin in a flashback. He's stripped of some of his titles and they're given to his female equivalent for the scene. The scene is in a peaceful city where his equivalent tells him, word for word, that his plan will lead to the Breaking, men going mad etc. At no point is it explained how she knows all this. The scene is depicted as an arrogant man not listening to a wise woman and going chasing glory instead of the reality that he was a desperate general trying the most desperate of long shots with just the men because the women refused to help since they fucked up their own scheme. The single, sole purpose of the scene was to put in-world Original Sin squarely on the shoulders of men.

So many times I could tell the episode was filmed on a stage near a freeway it looked so staged.

Boba's character development should have stopped after chilling with the Tuskens.  This whole crime boss storyline was terrible and its strikes me as weird that the most feared bounty hunter in the galaxy respected by Vader himself cant seem to get respect in a shitty desert planet.

Fennec is apparently the story narrator to help us stupids what's happening.  Also, she finally did something cooler than standing there with a smirk by taking down the Pike's hut.

The Grogu/Mando/Luke stuff was fantastic but needless.  Ruins my anticipation for the next season of Mandalorian.  I could have been just fine to be on the cliff hanger for the next episode of mando.

Why did the rancor just become godzilla when Boba got off?  Like, did Boba not have a plan after he got off?  Also, what reason were they shooting at it?  It didnt seem to be going after anyone is particular yet Din had to tell them to stop shooting.  Why did Din think riding it would lead to anything less than what he got?

bobas character development should have stopped after chilling with the tuskens  this whole crime boss storyline was terrible and its strikes me as weird that the most feared bounty hunter in the galaxy respected by vader himself cant seem to get respect in a shitty desert planet

fennec is apparently the story narrator to help us stupids whats happening  also she finally did something cooler than standing there with a smirk by taking down the pikes hut

the grogumandoluke stuff was fantastic but needless  ruins my anticipation for the next season of mandalorian  i could have been just fine to be on the cliff hanger for the next episode of mando

why did the rancor just become godzilla when boba got off  like did boba not have a plan after he got off  also what reason were they shooting at it  it didnt seem to be going after anyone is particular yet din had to tell them to stop shooting  why did din think riding it would lead to anything less than what he got  im just really baffled by that whole plot line  didnt payoff nearly as well as i had hoped

This is basic human psychology. Let me give you an example from where I come from. It's soviet union collapse. Famine and deficit. Thievery, opportunism, anger, prejudice, whole country went to shit. It's been decades since. There is no famine, there is no deficit. But one thing didn't change. Ever since that time people are very selfish, opportunistic, angry and prone to thievery. Then I came to UK. I dropped my wallet, someone patted me on the back and gave it to me. I lost my phone, someone brought it to a reception, where I lost it. People throw rubbish into a bin, not on the floor. People do not try to resolve differences with bullying and fighting at a smallest provocation. People are friendly, people are civil. It was a stark contrast to the culture I grew up in.

This has nothing to do with race. It's about culture and how cultures get affected by historical events. Black people in america are no exception to that rule. They've been through a lot and it damaged their culture. And that is the reason why victim mentality and sense of hopelessness is a lot more common. Or why crime statistics are disproportionally high compared to other cultures.

35395,85,3,"train",1,"/r/lotr",">My main question, if all of the above is accepted is this: are we ever given any in lore reason for why elves have ‘pointy ears’?

Who says they do? No joke, where is it ever stated in the entire Legendarium that elves have pointed ears? Never, explicitly. Now, that doesn't mean they surely *don't* have pointed ears, and there are a *few* reasons they might. But it's never stated.

Reasons they may have pointed ears: The elven (can't remember if it was Sindarin or what) word for *ear* shares roots with the word for *leaf,* or something like that, which people have interpreted to mean ""leaf-shaped"" ears, thus pointed. The other main reason is that Tolkien once described Hobbits as having ""elf-like"" ears (outside the books) and that elves commonly have pointed ears; however, that doesn't mean *his* elves have pointed ears, but only that they commonly do in myth.

Reasons they may not: Again, it is never stated that they do have pointed ears. In fact, anytime a character points out the difference between an Elf and a Man, it is usually by their face or, especially, their *eyes.* Never their ears.

So... just pick what you want. It seems most adaptations like giving them pointed ears. Also, I'm sure someone will stop by and explain all I said better. 

Sorry I don't have specific sources; like, I remember the context behind the Hobbit thing, but I don't have a link to a quote. *I believe* it was a letter from Tolkien about an artwork someone made, a map which depicted all his characters, and he picked it apart for all the discrepancies (even though he never described them in such detail).","my main question if all of the above is accepted is this are we ever given any in lore reason for why elves have pointy ears

I think in this context we have to remember the timeline of things, that basically video (motion picture and audio) were a ""new"" medium and not completely understood for JRR, and even Christopher. I also think the early adaptations were cause to stances taken on media adaptations. I really don't blame them. I think in the end, really what they were expecting, was that adaptations would be done with absolute respect to the work. No one that has adapted this to the big (or home) screen has done this. As much as many of us love the PJ films to some regard, no one, not even them, have done this. The big problem is that Bezos claimed he's a huge fan, bought the rights, gave a huge budget, and so you'd think these factors would result in an adaptation that *is* done with absolute respect to the work, but it clearly isn't.

Richard Linklater and Paul Thomas Anderson mostly stuck to their guns and made their own movies, and had varying degrees of success (critical mostly, not commercial).

Robert Rodriguez...god, what to say about him? In a sense, he's like his buddy Tarantino - they made movies their way, the sort of things they wanted to see, but Tarantino's borrow-from-the-best mentality moved him forward, while Rodriguez could only borrow from schlocky low-budget action movies.

42653,181,3,"train",1,"/r/lotr","Okay first off I'm sorry for being snippy/hostile there, I do genuinely see your points but I do want to propose my own views here too. 

>Dumping an odd person in a place where they stick out is a recipe for questions. Why deny that?

Of course I'm not, that definitely would raise questions. But isn't that a good thing? Isn't storytelling that makes you wonder interesting? 

I see a Haradrim in Rohan, and I don't think ""that's impossible, my immersion is ruined"", I think ""Oh, interesting. I wonder what he's doing there? Must be a story there"". 

Maybe it gets explained, maybe it doesn't, but either way I think something like that adds depth to the world. It creates exceptions, unique instances and stand-out moments which does happen quite often in real life. It makes Middle Earth feel more like a living, breathing place instead of a perfectly manicured fantasy diorama where everything stays perfectly in place. 

And even if it goes against ""Tolkien's Vision""... maybe I'm not against the change still? What if I like this new vision even better? An adaptation shouldn't have to be beholden to the creative vision of the original author. I think it's allowed to be it's own thing, bend the rules, forge a unique identity and tell a new kind of story with the old material. I bet a lot of people like Peter Jackson's version of the story better than Tolkien's too. He totally changed the characters personalities, so much so that they'd be frankly unidentifiable side by side, but I think that ultimately was a net positive for the series as a whole. I don't think it should be treated as sacrelige to feel that way. 

And yes, I agree, stories need rules and internal logic to a degree. When I say rules shouldn't get in the way of the story, I don't mean ""anything should be able to happen no matter what to make the story interesting"". Obviously there's limits there, but I don't really see how your example breaks the world to the point of ruining my suspension of disbelief. I can see how a clever writer could explain how a Haradrim person ended up in Rohan without breaking any hard rules of the setting. 

What I really meant is that softer rules, like ""travelling in Middle Earth is uncommon and many people don't venture away from their homelands"" can be interesting to see bent. Isn't the entirety of The Hobbit and LotR bending the soft rule of ""Hobbits are mild-mannered and meek, and don't often seek out excitement beyond their homesteads"" itself? That's what makes it so interesting in the first place. 

So that's really my thinking summarized. I ultimately think it would be a net positive for the story and the world to see unique and interesting things pop up like that.

I'm actually kinda sad that's not actually a thing that will happen and is entitely a hypothetical now, I got excited thinking of the interesting ways that could be explained by writers much more talented than I am, who could also use it as a way to expand on the Haradrim and make them a little more fleshed out than ""those evil elephant-riding folk from the south"".","okay first off im sorry for being snippyhostile there i do genuinely see your points but i do want to propose my own views here too

While that's not unique to those particular groups, the things those groups tend to like is the common tropes that they use as an allegory for their own ideologies. 

Diversity, inclusion, and female empowerment are not staples of high fantasy. They read it for damsels in distress, straight men who save them, black-and-white morality, rigid hierarchies, and the medieval, white European history that often transposes the settings and characters. This is why books or retellings of stories that diverge from that formula often get review bombed by gatekeepers from those groups. 

Take ""Priory of the Orange Tree"", for example, and how it was lambasted by uninformed critics over its tame-yet-progressive content because the author said it was a ""feminist's take on fantasy."" Reviewers called it preachy and woke, but that's not at all what the book is like. There are lesbian/gay relationships to complement the straight ones, there are strong female characters to complement the strong male ones, and there are characters of all races (as would be expected in a story that spans an entire world). 

In ""Priory.."", there's no grandstanding or sermons about how ""women are stronger than men"" nor are there speeches about how ""CIS white males are evil"" nor are their speeches about equality and oppressive traditional gender roles. The book just has the audacity to treat progressive ideas and characters as completely ordinary and accepted parts of that world. That's it. Gays and strong women are normal things. But that's enough to outrage these people. 

Conservatives and their ilk will simply hate it for being different, even in the most subtle ways.

27095,129,3,"train",1,"/r/lotr",">Visigoths  [...] were originally from maybe somewhere between modern day Ukraine to to modern day Kazakhstan.

There's a few things wrong with that statement. 

The question of where the Goths came from isn't entirely clear, but archaeology suggests that these came from a group on the southern part of the Baltic around the present day towns of Gdańsk and Chełmno and were the source or part of the Wielbark culture. There a question of whether these people originated in southern Sweden from either Götaland or Gotland via the Gutones, but that is heavily argued and far from settled.

The Visigoths tend to be more associated with the Thervingi that lived between the Dneiper and Lower Danube, in what is mostly today Romania and Moldavia. Whilst Jordanes isn't the best source, he links Alaric with the earlier Thervingi king Athanaric which meshes with the Goths settled in the area that he came from within the empire being the same as that settled by the Thervingi.

However this is largely an inaccurate way to conceptualise the Visigoths. Since the Gothic war in 376, previous ethno-cultural identities that the migrating Goths had were worn away and reforged anew with the treaty 418 granting them hospitalitas in Aquitania. During that gap the mixed group of Greuthungi, Thervingi and Alans that migrated across the Danube lost their previous tribal identities and were lumped under the term Goth along with the deserters and slaves that had joined them during the Gothic war. Alaric and his followers who hailed from this group took on more outsiders with the invasion of Italy with the desertion of the 'barbarian' soldiers after their families had been massacred following Stilicho's execution. This group then saw further mixing with the Gallo Romans of Aquitania following their settling there. Effectively during this time the group that had migrated over the river some 42 years ago had changed significantly in composition and had become heavily Romanised such that only a whittled core of what was still remained the same and were in effect a new people.","visigoths   were originally from maybe somewhere between modern day ukraine to to modern day kazakhstan

Legolas, for example, was nearly 3000 years old during the events of Lord of the Rings. He seems really young to me for that if we think in human years, not exactly a wise old leader vibe, but since to an Elf that's about 21 I guess that makes sense.

Arwen is around 2700 during LOTR as well, and again, seems young.

So I'd expect Galadriel to be around Arwen and Legolas in how young she seems/maturity level.

Its one of those things that breaks the Sequels for me.  I get the fantasy.  I like the fantasy.  Fantasy is all sorts of fun.  And suspending my disbelief is part of the fun.  

But this takes it a step too far.  Not the ability to do it, but the mindset of doing it.

See, if you have the capability of completing draining a star of its power....why do you need it to shoot a big gun?  Wouldn't it be more efficient to just, you know, knock a few planets out of orbit?  Or if you're really serious and you want everyone dead, use your ability to propel a planet through hyperspace to drag a giant meteor behind you and launch it toward a planet?  In theory, you don't need much and it's clear you can create a planet with a hyperdrive.  Why not make it smaller and launch a bunch of asteroids toward a star system?  Or just, you know, completely drain the sun of its fuel and watch while the entire star system's planets die in just a couple days as soon as the rays from the star stop reaching the planet?  I mean, you could do it just by positioning a big mirror in front of the planet to stop all light from reaching it.  If you have the technology to create Star Killer base in the first place...why do you need a weapon like Star Killer base?  Even better, you could just use that technology to create a black hole inside the planet like Star Trek.  Boom.  No planet.

but this takes it a step too far  not the ability to do it but the mindset of doing it

see if you have the capability of completing draining a star of its powerwhy do you need it to shoot a big gun  wouldnt it be more efficient to just you know knock a few planets out of orbit  or if youre really serious and you want everyone dead use your ability to propel a planet through hyperspace to drag a giant meteor behind you and launch it toward a planet  in theory you dont need much and its clear you can create a planet with a hyperdrive  why not make it smaller and launch a bunch of asteroids toward a star system  or just you know completely drain the sun of its fuel and watch while the entire star systems planets die in just a couple days as soon as the rays from the star stop reaching the planet  i mean you could do it just by positioning a big mirror in front of the planet to stop all light from reaching it  if you have the technology to create star killer base in the first placewhy do you need a weapon like star killer base  even better you could just use that technology to create a black hole inside the planet like star trek  boom  no planet  took less than  minutes didnt require you destroying an entire sun what a massive waste of resources too and the entire republic now bends to your will because apparently only like  people think destroying an entire star system is worth fighting even though previously destroying one planet was more than enough to get like a billion people fighting against you"

They didn’t flesh out Snoke enough for him to be an antagonist worth investing in like Palpatine either IMO. I also don’t really buy into the whole “it ruined Anakin’s actions” angle that people suggest because IMO that was always more so about balancing the force and redeeming his family than it was about saving the galaxy forever. He finally made the choice to be good, even if the world didn’t stay that way forever. Like him “killing” Palpatine was more symbolic than anything to me.

14507,187,3,"train",0,"/r/StarWars","I think Luke (like Lucasfilm) is still trying to figure out what role the Jedi should have in the galaxy. They're still trying to figure out what the Jedi should be. Lucas' prequel vision of what the Jedi were is not bad. They were not corrupt. They just didn't see what was coming. However, I can't see a return to that type of setup being very popular in today's social-political climate.

In the past, the Jedi were setup on-screen as role-models of morality. What Lucasfilm and Luke himself I think are struggling with, is how untenable that is. Therefore, screw it.

Let 'Jedi' become a term that evolves in-universe and in our world that refers to anyone trained in force use. Let there be different factions of Jedi. Rogue Jedi, Dark Jedi, etc. Have different 'Jedi Schools' like the ancient greeks. We refer to these schools by their founders or distinctive philosophies. There could be Skywalker Jedi, Ahsoka Jedi, Kanan Jedi, Ren Jedi, etc.

The Skywalker, Ahsoka, and Kanan Jedi Houses/Schools can be allies but have a few esoteric philosophical differences. The Ren Jedi are obviously going to be dark jedi and eventual enemies of the Skywalker Jedi. Perhaps the Ren Jedi could be a faction that broke away from the Ahsoka or Kanan Jedi schools. I feel the need to explain my thoughts on 'Kanan Jedi'. They are the jedi trained by Ezra if he is ever found and takes apprentices.

In short, the jedi are currently splintered and almost extinct. Let the splinter-groups prosper into independent sects. No council that rules all the sects. Each sect has it's own council of elders and those elders communicate with each other. Eventually, a Jedi Conference is established. Periodically, members of each sect will send delegates to a conference of jedi sects to share knowledge and discuss current issues. There are numerous ways these relationships could evolve at this point and an equal number or interesting jedi stories that could be told.

So, let's say a big story is brewing in the Mando time-period that involves Thrawn being a big threat. Ezra is found. Luke, Ahsoka, and Ezra team-up to fight this threat. During the course of that story, Luke, Ahsoka, and Ezra realize they have some very fundamental philosophical differences but put aside those differences to work together. At the conclusion of the story, they all agree to go their own separate ways and start their own schools. They all see the value of each others viewpoints and recognize (thanks to history) that it is best to refrain from forming an absolute order of jedi. They can keep each other check. Perhaps some members of their sects leave to join royal houses and train jedi warriors for those houses.","i think luke like lucasfilm is still trying to figure out what role the jedi should have in the galaxy theyre still trying to figure out what the jedi should be lucas prequel vision of what the jedi were is not bad they were not corrupt they just didnt see what was coming however i cant see a return to that type of setup being very popular in todays socialpolitical climate

Krrsantan being involved. He’s on the cover of the next Crimson Reign issue. He and Aphra are tied to the War of the bounty hunters and crimson reign comics in which Qi’ra is one of the main characters. 

The Pykes being the big bad but in all conversations, who is in control is referenced as “the Syndicate.” Not the Pyke syndicate. Seems intentional. The pykes were part of the shadow collective led by Maul and Crimson Dawn. 

The Hutts refuse to intervene. In the comics members of the Hutt council were a part of Crimson Dawn. They’ve since been killed by Vader. Jabba killed by Leia. My interpretation was that the twins want to regain power in that area but once they saw the Pykes, they realized that Crimson Dawn is in charge, and decided to wait it out. They were likely controlling Bib from afar. The gift of the rancor was them hoping Boba would win the fight in an effort to build an ally in their conflict with crimson dawn. 

Also in the Crimson Reign comics it’s stated that Qi’ra is intentionally starting a war between the syndicates while staying on the sidelines influencing as a “whisper.” The Hutts are mentioned as the other group also staying out of it as they have a contract with the empire. Leading me to believe that they are being set up to take over in the aftermath. This would also explain why the Hutts acted the way they did. No idea who else they would be afraid of.

Tolkien comes from a Judeo-Christian tradition and the books have a large expression of his faith in Christianity. Water and Fire both large and important symbols in the Christian faith.

In the Christian tradition water is mainly seen as rebirth in baptism. Fire in the same way destroys but is a main symbol for purifying. Mainly example from New Testament is the fire of baptism with the Holy Spirit. Plus more on both sides physical and spiritual. Both a double edged sword, neither side helps evil.

That is the intentional narrative device Tolkien uses in all his works: **Frame stories**. Whatever we read from Tolkien is to be understood as having been derived and sourced from in-universe sources from across the ages. Be they memoirs, historical manuscripts and so on.

This is important because this is how and why his works resemble genuine mythology. And that in itself is important because there are Myths that are always going to have that element of inaccuracy and unreliability. 

We can examine this in how we treat ""real"" mythologies like the Illiad, Arthurian tales, Mahabharata, Ramayana and so on. We never take it all literally as we have that implicit understanding when we read them and adapt them into different mediums.

33709,119,3,"train",1,"/r/lotr","I like to quote this scene as among those that simply hit harder when you watch the Theatrical Cut of the movies.

And it’s hard to pin down exactly why. One reason of course is the Intermission introduced by the 2-disc version, and the subsequent emotional breathing room and reset; but even when streaming the film, Gandalf’s death just does not hit as hard in the EE.

Maybe it’s simply a matter of time - in the TC, Gandalf falls before 2 hours of film have passed, and the audience might still be more receptive and less fatigued - but I think it’s a more deliberate matter of editing: the TC just never slows down as much as the EE, and when this *drop* happens as the Company reaches Azanulbizar, it feels like you’re allowed to breathe, and to reflect, and to mourn, for the first time since the film started. And when Boromir says *give them a moment*, it’s for the audience as well. Yes, give me a moment! But no, we’re off again.

This is not to belittle the obvious benefits of the EE, but like many I’d had watched nothing but the EE for ages, and when I watched the TC again, Gandalf’s fall hit me like a brick, in a way that it had not done for 15 years. There’s just a difference to that moment when you’ve not had the comfort of Concerning Hobbits, the joy of several Inn scenes, slower travel, and a much more elaborate, and homely, stay at the last homely house. Fellowship TC is a little darker, and a little more hopeless, and when Gandalf falls, it feels a little less sad perhaps, but quite a lot more desperate.

Maybe it’s just me. But I adore the differences between TC and EE; there’s many of those moments in the TCs, where the absence of something, or the closer temporal proximity of events, or an immediate cut from A to B, create elements of immersion and meaning that are lost in the EE.","i like to quote this scene as among those that simply hit harder when you watch the theatrical cut of the movies

3810,147,3,"train",0,"/r/StarWars","The way I see it Grogu took the same path as Tarre Visla. He spent around 50 years at the Jedi temple. He's spent a brief period with Luke reviewing the basics of the force. And they made a lot of progress. As you said: Luke's training with Yoda and Obi-wan was also extremely brief. I think Luke made Grogu choose because he felt like Grogu didn't want to be there. I don't think he would turn him away if Grogu came back for more guidance either. Yoda also gave Luke a similar ultimatum at the end of their first session. So Grogu and luke spending a similarly brief time makes sense. He likely had guidance from the force ghosts of his teachers but they couldn't have been there all the time, because if this was the  case we would see them all the time (at Luke's budding jedi academy for example). It makes sense that Luke is largely a self taught Jedi, and he probably spent a lot of time finding republic era and ancient Jedi texts and artifacts to learn everything he could about the Jedi ways. I think people expect him to be this perfect avatar of balance in the force because George said he's the strongest. we see characters like Ahsoka and Qui-Gon who have realized that the Jedi creed has some deeply rooted flaws and while Luke has an understanding of the failings of the Republic era Jedi he still started out as a kid who wanted to be a Jedi just like his father. He's not neccesarily a grey Jedi. I think this version of luke, who is not the same as the one from the post-empire era books of ""legends"", embraces the detatchment from passionate emotion in the Jedi doctrine. We see him begin to do so in his demeneor and tossing of lightsaber in Return of the Jedi. So to me it makes sense that he teaches in a way similar to how Yoda and other ""nicer"" Republic Jedi would. I think Mace Windu for example would have been much stricter and harsher than Luke, and Luke is still pretty far from this.

10438,622,3,"train",0,"/r/StarWars","Just seen The Book of Boba Fett finale.

Here are things I liked. The gang war kicks in and it becomes a crime drama I had hoped for. The Mando is great as always with him sticking to his teeth to repay his debt for Boba Fett. There is a jetpack scene that I couldn't believe they are doing it now at the finale. The Grogu reunion is adorable and I was worried if the series would go for the route of him staying with Luke. It turns out the showrunners made the right decision. Him using the Force to calm down the Rancor is another great moment. Cad Bane has charisma and could have been a great villain.

So let's talk about the cons. It's gonna be a list.

Out of the seven-episode season, there is only two-episode worth of the crime drama content. You can't shake off a feeling that all this is just rushed as hell. In the shows like Breaking Bad and Narcos, you can feel the brooding tension until the final confrontation becomes inevitable. Here, a third of the show is Boba flashbacks, the other third is The Mandalorian epilogue, and another third is actually devoted to the gang-related stuff. There is not sufficient build-up to make the battle cathartic. So what happens is the finale establishes too much because they failed to put in the work in making Mos Espa feel like a real place. They now have to explain the geography of Boba's assets and a bunch of the gang relations, and even after hearing it, I couldn't still figure out where the things were.

Outside of the Mando and Grogu, none of the side characters is memorable. The series so haphazardly sets up the cast of characters that I didn't give a shit who would live or die in the battle. Can anyone describe the unique quirks or personalities of the teenage bikers, Freetown people, the barkeeper, the clan bosses, the mayor, the comic relief Twi'lek secretary, the annoying mechanic lady, the Pike boss more than the surficial characterization? I can't. They are one-dimensional characters who have no depth--just robots to advance the plot. Even Cad Bane is lame as hell. Why wasn't he the main villain--an enforcer for the Pikes in the first place? He could have been a great foil to Boba, and there is a poignant dialogue between the two, but he gets introduced so late in the show to do any meaningful action. He doesn't do anything other than shoot at two people at Freetown. 

The gunfights are awful. I had a sneaking suspicion if Robert Rodriguez directed this one and watching the credits, yeah, I was right. There seems to be no storyboard, improvising shot to shot. One particular cinematography/editing confusion I noticed is, when normally you have good guys shooting at bad guys, you place good guys on the left side of the screen looking at right and place bad guys at the right side of the screen looking at left, so we don't get confused. This rule doesn't have to be kept all the time, but the majority of shots organized this way helps orient the audience. There is no consideration like this. For each cut, I had to reorient what I was looking at.

After the initial 'supposed' plan fails, the episode devolves into the two Mandalorians running out to the open area and right into the center of the snipers, being shot on from all sides, and only relying on their (plot) armors despite their armors not covering their entire bodies. None of them gets hurt. They literally have jetpacks and only use them once. No tactic, taking cover, using mobility, or anything. Actually, everyone's plot armor is so strong that the black Wookiee somehow survives from all those Pike lackeys? Did they just climb the Wookiee and not just... you know, shoot at him? He does get shot several times, but it has no effect on him at all. Everyone running in a straight line and no one gets shot by the massive droidekas. CGI looks awful here, a huge gap from how much looked great in the last episode. The crab droids and the Rancor look like the Prequel-level CGI. 

The actual plan to take down the Pike Syndicate is lackluster as hell. I was actually wondering, okay, there is no way Boba only takes 7 guys to take down hundreds of Pike gangs. He has to have another plan... it turns out, that's the plan. Mos Espa looks as if it has a population of at the very least five hundred thousand people, and Boba doesn't even care to recruit more. He really thinks he can control the lawless city full of criminals and various interests with barely over ten people. You can't even control Freetown with that number. Then he acts shocked that he is losing the war. There is a moment in which he rejects to go back to the palace and decides to use the destroyed cantina in the city so he can... fight for the people there...? Fight inside the city where civilian casualties and collateral damage are unavoidable??? Then he fucking rides a Rancor and goes full Godzilla on the city. What happened to ""I'm gonna rule the city by protecting people, earning them respect""? Does he want to save the city or not? What's funny is that this episode could have given him some sort of moral dilemma: should he use the Rancor and destroy the city to save the city? What's the lesser evil option here? No, the episode just ends with people cheering for him. HE DESTROYED MORE BUILDINGS THAN THE PIKES. 

Also, what's the point of bringing the massacre of the Tuskens up again? The Pike leader casually mentioning it to Cad Bane doesn't give it the weight the first four episodes have built up--especially when over half of those episodes were devoted to the Tusken flashbacks. When Boba hears it, he isn't all that distraught by the revelation. It doesn't change the plot in any way, shape, or form. Cad Bane tells it to Boba, which the show thinks it is setting up a rivalry between the two, but Cad Bane isn't the one who killed the Tuskens; Pikes did, so what's the point? Boba might have a personal vendetta against the Pikes, but it changes nothing. Hell, Fennec is the one who kills Pike leaders and the mayor. Again, why not have Boba kill them? As written in the show, Boba's motivation constantly shifts. He wants to retire, wants to be a boss, wants to have revenge on the Pikes, and now, it's ""these are my people"" as if he never spent years terrorizing Tatooinian civilians and working for their oppressors. The external conflict is solved, but I cannot tell what internal conflict is solved for him. He wins, and that's it. 

Mando and Fennec do everything. Din goes inside the shield and sets off bombs (why does anyone else never think of this?), Fennec kills the villains and pretty much ends the war. All the while Boba wrecks the town, killing hundreds of people including civilians, and lets the Rancor loose because Boba wants to ""rule with respect"". All this time staying in the bacta tank and thinking about if the bad guys need to be killed for over half of the series; the entire show could have been ended in the first episode if Boba told her to go and kill the Pike boss and the mayor. Actually, why does Fennec want to be loyal to Boba Fett? He constantly makes dumbass calls. She doesn't share interests other than Boba saving Fennec. They talk with each other barely. What's her agenda? What's the driving engine or desire of her character? What's stopping her from just killing Boba and taking the throne? 

To be fair, I can see Boba's ideal becoming popular, worthy of earning him the ruler of Mos Espa. Branding himself as a populist, Tatooine for Tatooine, no outside criminal influence from the galaxy, no spice dealings, providing real, proper jobs for people, and branding the Pikes as colonizers. Boba could have traveled around the galaxy and met some other conglomerates to improve the infrastructures and set up businesses there. Then people might ally with him and overthrow the mayor and Pikes. The Battle of Algiers (1966) but on Tatooine with civilians led by Boba waging guerilla warfare. That would have been amazing. But in the show, civilians have no way of knowing who Boba is or what his intentions are anyway. Boba never made a speech or spread propaganda to the people. He never announced anything to the public. It wasn't the 'people' who banded together for a higher ideal to overthrow the Pikes, it was just a bunch of biker kids, mercs, bounty hunters, and Freetown people who felt they were obligated to the Mando's request. The whole battle itself is ridiculous, but what's even dumber is there is nothing stopping the Pike Syndicate from invading Mos Espa again. They are one of the biggest criminal conglomerates and have set up their own establishments in thousands of systems. 

As written as it is, I cannot understand the creative decision behind the show. What does this show want to be? Is this show about how Boba survived from ROTJ, The Mandalorian epilogue, or Boba wanting to control Mos Espa? Disney, Favreau, Filoni, and Rodriguez made a show about a crimelord who does no crime, who has only seven followers and lives in a castle in the desert. There is no consistent vision other than making Boba Fett as a protagonist and bringing back a bunch of fan-favorite characters. I am floored.","just seen the book of boba fett finale

The only time we see Gandalf use his full power is when he fought the Balrog, who is also a Maiar, albeit a corrupted version. Their staffs do act as conduits for their power and without them they cant use their power while in Middle Earth. 

6. Because magic. Basically by poisoning Frodo it was turning him into a wraith under the Witch Kings power. Plus it looks cool.

7.Elves are basically weightless. Legolas walks on top of snow while everyone else has to wade theough. So yes she is less of a burden to her horse and Frido doesn't weigh much so she will be quicker.

8. The wraiths may feer the river Anduin as it is the realm of Elrond Halfelven, a powerful elf and weilder of one of the Elven rings of power (Vilya, ring of air and the mightiest of the Elven Rings) which were forged by Celebrimbor an Elven smith not by Sauron.

9. Elves are immortal but can die of wounds, poison and ailment and ironically, depression. Can get so depressed they die. Elves are the firstborn race and their role was always to be a guide to the other races on how to take care of middle earth. It was always their role to leave once the other races gained a foothold. I think.

10. Regular orcs can move in sublight but it greatly weakens and hurts them.

11. By putting on the ring Frodo has claimed it and thus his fate is tied to the ring.  The ring drains its wearers strength and vitality over time. Again another creative licence by Peter Jackson to show this I believe.

12. Quenya. High elf gobbildy gook that does magical things haha. Magic elf language. Has great power.

13. Has to be direct sunlight, underground light isn't strong enough. Also artificial.

This was written at 2:00 in the morning so if there are any mistakes I'm blaming lack of sleep. Thats my story and I'm sticking to it.","sauron is in laymens terms an angel maiar he bound his spirit or essence if you will to the ring his physical form can die but his sprit lingers in middle earth as the ring is a kind of anchor to  the world if you will so long as the ring exists so does sauron the big boom and shockwave was cinematic license by the films plus it just looks cool haha 

 simply just biology

 in the books the nazgul have an ability called the black breath that instilled fear in all living things i think the screeching is simply a cinematic change to that screeching sound to  show the demoralising effect of their presence they can speak and their voices are screechy

 iirc the wraiths arent scared of water but their mounts are

18913,192,3,"train",0,"/r/StarWars","They should've had the balls to do the Shadow Academy storyline from Young Jedi Knights instead.  
  
In it, a Force-sensitive man named Brakiss was trained by the Inquisitorius from childhood. Some years after the fall of the Empire, he was sent undercover to Luke's Jedi Academy on Yavin 4 to sabotage it, and steal whatever secrets and training he could.  
  
Luke instantly figured out what was going on, yet decided to train him anyways, working to turn him to the Light Side. However, he ultimately failed, and Brakiss fled the academy, becoming an apprentice to the Dark Jedi Kueller (another former student of Luke's Academy).  
  
Eventually, the Imperial Remnant and New Republic signed a peace treaty, and Brakiss joined up with a bunch of warlords who refused to honor the accords, forming the Second Imperium led by a resurrected Emperor Palpatine.  
  
Brakiss and a group of exiled Nightsisters were put in charge of the Shadow Academy, a Dark Side version of Luke's Academy, dedicated to training an army of Dark Jedi to serve the Emperor, who eventually sends them to Yavin 4 to wipe out the Jedi Academy as proof to the Imperial Remnant that they should break the peace and swear loyalty to the Second Imperium.  
  
However, their assault on the Academy fails. They manage to cause some limited destruction, but take heavy losses. Brakiss manages to flee back to the Shadow Academy, forcing his way into the Emperor's chambers, begging him to intervene and secure their victory... only to find out it was all a sham. Four Imperial Royal Guards had been using audio- and holorecordings to fake the Emperor's return.  
  
Brakiss falls into despair, and manages to kill three of the Royal Guards before the fourth escapes, setting off the Shadow Academy self destruct, killing Brakiss and ending the crisis.  
  
---  
  
With that setup, we could get more Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine, but *without* the whole ""Emperor has returned through Sith bullshit"" bit (and without undoing what Anakin did).    
  
It would mix things up, giving us a smaller storyline instead of just repeating the ""small resistance versus massive Empire with superweapons"" (and can still get stories about Luke feeling guilt, corruption in the New Republic, NR officials not believing in an obvious threat, etc).  
  
Disney would also still get a ton of different lightsaber designs, character designs, new species, new ships, etc for toys.  
  
EDIT: Another bonus; Brakiss is described as beautiful and charming, so he makes a really nice and compelling villain with how ugly and dark he is inside, and how he sometimes seems unable to reconcile that.","they shouldve had the balls to do the shadow academy storyline from young jedi knights instead

I think people are trying to lend their opinions more social weight or whatever instead of just saying they don't like the aesthetic, which has a large subjective component, but is probably more honest for what's bothering most people.

Another thing I might argue is that physical appearance, while not the be-all end-all, tells a story in a visual medium like this. In reality, diverse skin color connotes diverse ancestry, which is a fine concept, but it's poor storytelling to include an element like that without regard to the implications. That would be more convincing than just yelling ""it's political!"" which most people seem to be doing. I haven't seen the Denzel Macbeth, but based on a few images I just found of the production, I think an argument could be made that that aesthetic choice was thoughtful - the visuals of the film seem to be extremely abstract and uncanny.

The minor scale can invoke a lot of different feelings, the most common being sadness or danger, as opposed to the major scale (used for the Main Theme title crawl) which typically sounds happy. Williams brilliantly uses the minor scale to sound hopeful in the Force theme and bouncy/adventurous in Rey’s theme. But that’s the only connection: they use a similar collection of notes. I highly doubt William’s is specifically referencing Palpatine in Rey’s theme.

Compare this with Kylo’s theme, which definitely gives off Imperial March vibes.

I never really got Boba's transition from cold blooded bounty hunter to... crime lord/governor of a city. I didn't get why he was so naïve as to how to run his crime empire/city. He has to be told repeatedly by other characters that maybe he needs muscle.... that money can buy muscle... that he needs influence... but all he does is walk from the town to his palace wondering why nobody respects him. He makes a truce with other crime families and just expects them to not betray him. He bets his life on this. The same Boba Fett who grew up in the middle of war, who bounty hunted with the best for decades, that was so badass he could talk back to Vader.

I get that Boba's time with the Tuskens supposedly changed him. But the time passed is unclear (I think it's five years?) and poorly depicted. Also... he was initially enslaved and tortured by them. I concede, his time with them might have softened him, but it shouldn't have made him so naïve and clueless as to how to run a criminal enterprise. Again, no problem with him going soft and maybe even good. But he should not be an idiot. Then, his time with them doesn't really translate to a wish to rule Tatooine's towns for peace and order. These are the very same people that hated and feared Tuskens.

I think it's amusing that Cad Bane leans into this issue. The writers seem so aware of the implausibility of Boba's character, that they have to have Cad Bane straight up ask and wonder what the fuck is wrong with Boba. What's his angle? Yeah, it's not very clear to us either, Cad.

Then there's the fact there's hardly any character interaction or development. Nearly all dialogue is just people describing their actual situation, and what they will do next, and then doing it. The finale get-together of characters old and new should work on a deeper level than the plain spectacle and show it provides. We should care about these characters and these relationships, but there's hardly anytime for them to be human (or alien) to each other.

I could go on. How reuniting Din with Grogu so soon after Mando S2 undermines that narrative climax, and resets the status quo so soon. How the best two episodes in the series hardly have Boba in them. How Robert Rodriguez has a talent for making everything look like an amateur fan film, with his odd action and blocking.

Not every marvel movie is great, but feige clearly is intelligent enough to understand when fan service is a slam dunk and when it's just going to get in the way.

 I can think of so many examples of it. In shang-chi you get to see references to Extremis from Iron Man 3, a black widow that was in the 2021 movie, Abomination, and Wong, but they appear at the beginning of the second act and don't detract from the plot. They serve to show how Shang-Chi is being introduced to a mystical and super powered world. Then Wong doesn't show up again until at the very end of the movie when the story is concluded. Civil War is both an Avengers movie and a Captain America movie, and smartly ties Tony to the story by connecting Bucky to his parent's death, which was established way back in the first MCU movie, giving us the fight between Cap and Tony without making the entire scenario feel contrived. 

For some reason it just feels like Star Wars doesn't have the proper leadership to make this happen. I wonder if jumping around the timeline so much is part of it? If Mando had happened before The Force Awakens, would everything turn out for the better? Would Grogu be a main character?

The Witcher on Netflix chose to use a racially diverse cast and in the show it’s not addressed in any way. Netflix went with the approach that skin color did not matter to them for the shows casting. to me it looks kind of goofy and hinders the world building as a show could use different ethnic groups to differentiate between places. Too little is known about how this show will handle things. Will they go with the Witcher approach where an actor may be black but the character not necessarily from Harad, or will a black character living and traveling wherever has a background that come from harad. There is a difference between the two. Or if we see brown or Asian looking actors I hope the show uses them as Easternlings rather just mixing them in. So to summarize I hope they do NOT go the way of the Witcher, but rather use black and brown character to build out the world. With that said if the show has large numbers of Easternlings and people from harad living through the whole of middle earth that would looks strange to me because I don’t recall tolkin describing anything like that.

You say Samwise was strong enough to kill Frodo. That is the opposite of what Tolkien would have felt. He would have felt Samwise was strong enough to have not killed Frodo.

Catholic doctrine teaches that killing is a grave sin. The utilitarian idea that you can kill someone in order to stop some probable future catastrophe goes directly against Catholic teachings. While it may make sense from a logical utilitarian point of view for Sam to kill Frodo or Elrond to kill Isildur, that would have been seen as a staining act of evil in Tolkiens eyes, one that would have marred the person to their core.

Self defense or defense of another may lead to a killing which itself is not intentional. That would not be a sin in the same way, but an intentional killing in order to effectuate some possible defense of others is a sin (Catechism 2263). 

So no, I don’t think Sam would have killed Frodo. Nor do I think that a failure to do so would be because of a lack of emotional strength, but rather because Tolkien would have seen it as an abundance of moral strength.","whenever i see a thread like this or questioning why elrond didnt kill isildur i feel like people dont understand tolkiens catholic influence you say samwise was strong enough to kill frodo that is the opposite of what tolkien would have felt he would have felt samwise was strong enough to have not killed frodo

Elrond was not the only guy there. Glorfindel was also there. The problem is you haven't read Peoples of Middle-earth. 

Galadriel was also there. The problem is you haven't read the books and you are citing online wikis. 

in this version Galadriel leaves Eregion in 1350 SA, and tries to strengthen Lorien, and she herself doesn't return to Eregion when Sauron attacks Eregion, instead she sends her army to aid Eregion. She probably stayed in Lorien because she feared enemies might attack Lorien as well and she needs to stay to defend Lorien. Celeborn who had stayed in Eregion leads an army and greatly defends Eregion against Sauron until he with Elrond retreat and establish Imladris. 

However this story was later abandoned. In the later versions apparently Celeborn AND Galadriel led that army of Eregion, and they didn't retreat with Elrond to Imladris.

From Parma Eldalamberon 17: ""...Galadriel and Celebom only retreated thither [to Lorien] after downfall of Eregion.""

"" [The language in Lorien, though Frodo found it hard to understand, was actually, except in a few names of persons and places, simply Sindarin of Beleriand, brought in by Galadriel and Celeborn, and their followers, who after the destruction of Eregion passed through Moria...

The page was placed with others within the covers of the writing-pad labelled ""Galadriel"" ..... ]""

In a note from 1965 it is stated "" ....the story of Celeborn and Galadriel, and their connexion with
Lórien. 
The best story seems to be that outlined under “Galadriel”,  in which
they take part in the settlement of Eregion, and later of its defence against
 Sauron. But another possibility is that hinted at in the proposed
emendations to the “Tale of Years” (LR III 366), by which they did not
come to Lórien till TA 1060."" - Nature of Middle-earth 

No such emendation was made to Tale of the Years. 

And in 1969 Tolkien wrote: ""... Noldor (of Sindarin speech), who passed through Moria after the destruction of Eregion by Sauron in the year 1697 of the Second Age. At that time ... Celeborn went at first to Lórien and fortified it against any further attempts of Sauron to cross the Anduin. When however Sauron withdrew to Mordor, and was (as reported) wholly concerned with conquests in the East, Celeborn rejoin­ed Galadriel in Lindon."" And Christopher elaborates ""The implication of the extract just given is that after Eregion's fall Celeborn led this migration to Lórien, while Galadriel joined Gil-galad in Lindon; but elsewhere, in a writing contemporary with this, it is said explicitly that they both at that time ""passed through Moria with a considerable following of Noldorin exiles and dwelt for many years in Lórien."" "" - Unfinished Tales

This 'elsewhere' writing is published in full in Nature of Middle-earth, I quote part of it here: ""Thus already in the Second Age Oropher had withdrawn northward beyond the
confluence of the Gladden and Anduin: to be free from the power and encroachments of the Dwarves
of Moria, and still more, after the fall of Eregion, from the “domination” of Celeborn and Galadriel.

All of it. When you start removing elements it is losing authenticity. 

>Take a look at the Hamilton musical. It did a great story of Alexander Hamilton and its casting was via the 'modern' america. It didn't matter one bit that the George Washington we saw on stage was black. Like, there is no faithlessness here unless the only thing that matters to you about George was his skin colour and not his deeds/words

Kind of funny that you chose a musical that specifically went out of it's way to cast non-whites as historically white figures. I mean sure that example should be a work that you're against? 
But yes. It's even worse for changing historical figures who are white into non-white. 

>Again, same with Shakespeare and even literature from different countries. Japan adapts lots of western literature and they have Japanese actors in it! Likewise, we've adapted Asian literature, asian myths and used our western actors. 

>Should we made at them for casting based on what reflects their society of today? No, because really it's just about stories being told by the artists of today and the artists of today are made up of a diverse group of people because our society is diverse and we're better for it as it is reflected in our works

This whole bit is..... odd. I seem to recall that there is a specific concept called ""whitewashing"" that we are told is very bad and harmful. But does that not apply here? 
You're also going to need some examples of these Japanese works we are adapting. 

>And what exactly are the authenticity markers for the entirely made up fantasy world of Middle Earth? Are we really going to just draw the line at skin colour? Especially when we know from Tolkien's letters he'd probably be opposed to that kind of attitude?

all of it when you start removing elements it is losing authenticity 

take a look at the hamilton musical it did a great story of alexander hamilton and its casting was via the modern america it didnt matter one bit that the george washington we saw on stage was black like there is no faithlessness here unless the only thing that matters to you about george was his skin colour and not his deedswords

kind of funny that you chose a musical that specifically went out of its way to cast nonwhites as historically white figures i mean sure that exle should be a work that youre against 
but yes its even worse for changing historical figures who are white into nonwhite 

again same with shakespeare and even literature from different countries japan adapts lots of western literature and they have japanese actors in it likewise weve adapted asian literature asian myths and used our western actors 

should we made at them for casting based on what reflects their society of today no because really its just about stories being told by the artists of today and the artists of today are made up of a diverse group of people because our society is diverse and were better for it as it is reflected in our works

this whole bit is odd i seem to recall that there is a specific concept called whitewashing that we are told is very bad and harmful but does that not apply here 
youre also going to need some exles of these japanese works we are adapting 

and what exactly are the authenticity markers for the entirely made up fantasy world of middle earth are we really going to just draw the line at skin colour especially when we know from tolkiens letters hed probably be opposed to that kind of attitude

literally the cultural and historic setting its being adapted from would you have such a blaise attitude about the adaption of mulan or aladdin"

35675,253,3,"train",1,"/r/lotr","1) I'm not a fan of the timeline scrunching either. Peter Jackson did it (obviously to a smaller extent) with Frodos timeline leaving the shire. In that case, I'm not sure it made the story better, but it certainly didn't make it worse. I think that in a vacuum, it can make the story they want to tell better. The problem here is that by doing it here, it cuts down on the possible additional content they can create in the same universe. If you look at the star wars tv universe, they're doing all the these spinoff shows. You'll have a really hard time doing that with any sense of lore consistency when you're scrunching the primary story up to 1/10th it's original duration.

2) I'm ok with galadriel being in locations that she wasn't. Again, Peter Jackson made changes like this for the sake of a consistent story. The history of middle earth, spanning centuries, had many important characters, but rarely were those characters together. As in, there's not a single primary protagonist, so creating a single storyline like they want to do, you're going to have to shift where people were at certain points. Also, we know there are some additional characters, and while galadriel is a main character, we don't know that she'll necessarily be a pivotal character in any of these battles she may or may not end up participating in. 

3) regarding elf hair, I'm on my phone and can't easily check which thread spawned this conversation, but I did explain why the same logic used to determine dwarves should generally be white indicates most elves have shorter hair. I personally agree that they should have long hair, but that is PURELY because I want a more consistent look with Peter Jacksons films, which we know break canon with character descriptions A LOT. Regardless, long haired elves are sort of the norm to me because of Peter Jacksons films and anything outside that definitely feels off, but I'm willing to go with it if the story is good. For all I know, the show will be so good that short haired elves become the new norm. 

4) cleanliness. I'm not going to judge a series pre-emptively because the promo shots are clean or super glossy. Like the photos for all we know were set up and taken explicitly for promotional content. I didnt really get that same general vibe from the trailer, but each snippet was so short I guess it is hard to say either way. The only thing I can even really recall is the hobbit who thinks they're radagast and has berries growing in their hair or some shit. To be fair though elves were always super clean even in PJs stuff. 

5) humans in middle earth are dark skinned in eastern and southern regions. The earth at this point isn't even old enough to have developed significant differences in skin color so even the men of middle earth, who we know are darker skinned, shouldn't be darker skinned. If you're really stuck on the melanin thing, just write it off as some dwarves having been carved from dark stone, this dark skin. Coincidentally, those dwarves settles in the east. Like, it's easy to write off if we want to so I'm not going to be too fussed about it.

6) I personally don't care about the beards. Add them, don't. Like, for me it's whatever and it's one of those pieces of canon that I never would have even remembered if it weren't for everyone making a big deal of it. To be honest at this point I tune out for most of the films unless they're action sequences because by and large I know what's being said. Seen them dozens of times right. So have beards, don't have beards, I'm cool either way. In fact, I'd honestly prefer no beards for the same reason I'd prefer more subtle elf ears - girls with beards are ugly and giant pointed ears are ugly and I'm shallow. But that being said it does seem like a piece of lore that for whatever reason a lot of fans love, I suppose because it's one of the funnier moments in an otherwise not super funny film","im not a fan of the timeline scrunching either peter jackson did it obviously to a smaller extent with frodos timeline leaving the shire in that case im not sure it made the story better but it certainly didnt make it worse i think that in a vacuum it can make the story they want to tell better the problem here is that by doing it here it cuts down on the possible additional content they can create in the same universe if you look at the star wars tv universe theyre doing all the these spinoff shows youll have a really hard time doing that with any sense of lore consistency when youre scrunching the primary story up to th its original duration

13272,127,3,"train",0,"/r/StarWars","I think out of all the Disney+ MCU/Star Wars stuff that does the big, long fight scenes in its season finale, this one kinda dragged on and was shot terribly. I like some of Robert Rodriguez's work, like Machete and Planet Terror, but I think his film style isn't best suited for Star Wars.

It's also the worst show out of all these Disney+ geek stuff, since it attempted to juggle the Tusken and the Crime Lord plots, former had better development that helped shaped Boba Fett from badass legend to kid-friendly Bantha enthusiast who hates space drugs. Both plotlines could have been better paced. While we know Boba became a Crime Lord, it took a couple episodes for him to explain why he chose that new path. For the Crime Lord plot, they could have shown how the spice or the Syndicate's influence would have affected the local citizens.

You know something's funky if the Mando episodes are well loved more than the (old) fan-favorite Boba Fett. Even so, Mando visiting Luke's school/reuniting with Grogu should have been saved for their show since it removes most of Season 2's importance and weight. Imagine if in Mandalorian S2, after Boba Fett got reintroduced, there are now three episodes about his time with the Tuskens, with Mando's plot getting underdeveloped/rushing to the big fight.

Overall, I expected a bit more grittiness to a show about one of the best Star Wars characters who helped shaped the ""Mandalorian"" culture, but I guess the grittiness tone ended up being reserved for Mando in his return episode.

So, I think you make fun of people who are actually saying that this Galadriel is bad because she is a strong female character - if that is what you are trying to say, then I agree, those people are dumb. But, I do have to say, that I dont like this version of Galadriel. She looks puny for what she is supposed to be, that armor looks ""interesting"" to put it nicely and she doesn't look as beautyful as she should. I dont mean, the access looks ugly, but for a 8 foot tall muscled amazon woman, with hair braided like a crown and unearthly beauty, she does look like someone any dude could find at the bar of a country club or something. She looks way too human and normal good - there is nothing special about her. If she was just supposed to be an elven commander, I'd still dont like her as much, but I could get over that, but as Galadriel she simply doesn't work for me. What I also find a bit of an unwise choice for her is full armor and a sword. I dont mind the horse (I really dont get why people are annoyed by that), she probably would be a pretty good rider, but a sword? For someone who is supposed to be more of a magic combatant and someone who fights defensively, she does seem a bit too much like an action hero instead of a wise commander who only fights to protect. I mean, if they dont have the right for that version of her, than they should leave her out. Why would someone adapt something they barely even have the rights for? That's absurd to do and it is even absurder to think that the fans wouldn't get upset about it. At this point you have no choice but to write fanfiction and at that point you should just leave it be and dump the project - what was always, in every adaptation, the biggest thing fans got mad about? Changes from the source. So making a show, completely based upon changes from the source seems stupid to me.

34882,226,3,"train",1,"/r/lotr","For anyone who doesn't know, this isn't a fan theory - it's a direct quote from Tolkien, published in the *Myths Transformed* section of *The History of Middle Earth Volume X: Morogoth's Ring*. To give a little more context:

> Melkor 'incarnated' himself (as Morgoth) permanently. He did this so as to control the hroa,(2) the 'flesh' or physical matter, of Arda. He attempted to identify himself with it. A vaster, and more perilous, procedure, though of similar sort to the operations of Sauron with the Rings. Thus, outside the Blessed Realm, all 'matter' was likely to have a 'Melkor ingredient',(3) and those who had bodies, nourished by the hroa of Arda, had as it were a tendency, small or great, towards Melkor: they were none of them wholly free of him in their incarnate form, and their bodies had an effect upon their spirits.  
> But in this way Morgoth lost (or exchanged, or transmuted) the greater part of his original 'angelic' powers, of mind and spirit, while gaining a terrible grip upon the physical world. For this reason he had to be fought, mainly by physical force, and enormous material ruin was a probable consequence of any direct combat with him, victorious or otherwise. This is the chief explanation of the constant reluctance of the Valar to come into open battle against Morgoth. Manwe's task and problem was much more difficult than Gandalf's. **Sauron's, relatively smaller, power was concentrated; Morgoth's vast power was disseminated. The whole of 'Middle-earth' was Morgoth's Ring**, though temporarily his attention was mainly upon the North-west. Unless swiftly successful, War against him might well end in reducing all Middle-earth to chaos, possibly even all Arda.  
> It is easy to say: 'It was the task and function of the Elder King to govern Arda and make it possible for the Children of Eru to live in it unmolested.' But the dilemma of the Valar was this: Arda could only be liberated by a physical battle; but a probable result of such a battle was the irretrievable ruin of Arda. Moreover, the final eradication of Sauron (as a power directing evil) was achievable by the destruction of the Ring. No such eradication of Morgoth was possible, since this required the complete disintegration of the 'matter' of Arda. Sauron's power was not (for example) in gold as such, but in a particular form or shape made of a particular portion of total gold. Morgoth's power was disseminated throughout Gold, if nowhere absolute (for he did not create Gold) it was nowhere absent. (It was this Morgoth-element in matter, indeed, which was a prerequisite for such 'magic' and other evils as Sauron practised with it and upon it.) It is quite possible, of course, that certain 'elements' or conditions of matter had attracted Morgoth's special attention (mainly, unless in the remote past, for reasons of his own plans).

The short version is that all physical beings and matter within Middle Earth are tainted and corrupted to some extend by Morgoth, and thus that the only way to ever fully defeat him would be the complete destruction of the world. As we are told in the end of *The Silmarillion*:

> Yet the lies that Melkor, the mighty and accursed, Morgoth Bauglir, the Power of Terror and of Hate, sowed in the hearts of Elves and Men are a seed that does not die and cannot be destroyed; and ever and anon it sprouts anew, and will bear dark fruit even unto the latest days.","for anyone who doesnt know this isnt a fan theory  its a direct quote from tolkien published in the myths transformed section of the history of middle earth volume x morogoths ring to give a little more context

TLJ continued this struggle and set him and the first order up to be the main opposing force with now very personal reasons for going after the resistance beyond imperialism. The final film should have made this struggle within Kylo Ren coexist with his need for control over the galaxy so that instead of a pure evil emperor just wanting to be in charge again? Kylo Ren’s inner struggle could have been the metaphor for the balance of the force and representing a truly balanced force user who is able to use both the dark and light side.

TFA made Rey looking for belonging the most important thing to her character. TLJ deconstructed the idea of family and belonging in that Rey had the power to create her own belonging and now include others by keeping on with the jedi tradition. The final film should have kept with this by having Rey recruit force users interested in becoming jedi and starting a new nomadic jedi academy in honor of Luke, it being a jedi academy and in honor of Luke could further provoke kylo ren because of how emotionally painful his experience was at Luke’s hands.

Setting up Snoke in TFA was such a boring idea for a villain, basically emperor 2.0. TLJ killed him off so Kylo could be the main villain who we could also see struggling. Hux being set up to antagonize Kylo Ren in the final film and even potentially being the one to kill him in the climax could have been awesome. Instead in TROS Hux was giving info to the resistance? If anything TROS ruined Hux, not TLJ.

TFA set Finn up as a reluctant soldier. He didn’t want to fight in the first scene. He tried to hide. He also was trying to escape the whole conflict the entire time. It wasn’t until the very end that he finally stood up for what was right, and then he got completely destroyed. TLJ had to pick up the pieces of that, Finn should have also helped fight Kylo in TFA, reinforcing him as a hero and having an injured Kylo Ren lose to two burgeoning force users makes more sense than losing to just one.
TLJ continued this arc for Finn in the beginning, backsliding because he was almost killed and trying to run away again. Rose reminded him that he was looked up to and admired for what he did in the first movie, and that gave him the courage to continue the fight. The final film should have continued this and had Finn be actively involved with turning other fo stormtroopers.

Luke was shoved onto an island and only given five seconds of screen time for the entirety of the first saga film he could have been in for 30 years. TFA should have been using Luke the whole time and the whole plot around trying to find a puzzle piece to a map to find him? That was dumb, come on. TLJ had to have a reason for Luke not fighting back against the first order and being in that remote location. TFA screwed things up for Luke by writing him into a corner. At least in TLJ we had a reason that made sense and that reason was consistent with the story already set up.

I agree with you on Poe’s character to some extent. But TFA showed his recklessness often caused damage to those around him, emotionally and physically. TLJ should have continued this arc with him learning to have balance, but the way he was left in the dark about certain plans didn’t make sense to me. Poe was originally supposed to have died in TFA. Maybe he should have and that would remain as part of Finn’s resolve to carry on in TLJ and in TROS.","tfa showed kylo ren to be deeply struggling tlj continued this struggle and set him and the first order up to be the main opposing force with now very personal reasons for going after the resistance beyond imperialism the final film should have made this struggle within kylo ren coexist with his need for control over the galaxy so that instead of a pure evil emperor just wanting to be in charge again kylo rens inner struggle could have been the metaphor for the balance of the force and representing a truly balanced force user who is able to use both the dark and light side

i agree with you on poes character to some extent but tfa showed his recklessness often caused damage to those around him emotionally and physically tlj should have continued this arc with him learning to have balance but the way he was left in the dark about certain plans didnt make sense to me poe was originally supposed to have died in tfa maybe he should have and that would remain as part of finns resolve to carry on in tlj and in tros"

I see the problem. You're confusing the real-life definition of race (color/origin based) and the Middle Earth definition of race (different species with different physiologies). 

Black elves are still elves. The whole point I'm making is that their skin color wouldn't change that.

11657,175,3,"train",0,"/r/StarWars","So, overall, I found the series entertaining, but not terribly fulfilling. The individual character arcs were interesting, the dialogue was pretty decent, most of the acting was OK.

However, I don't think Temuera Morrison really did a lot more than look stoic and I still think it would have made more sense, agewise, to bring back Daniel Logan and age him up a little rather than pretending that time in a Sarlacc can not only make you older but also pudgier. I have no idea whether Logan can act or not, but this was not exactly challenging acting so I don't understand the choice, especially since sources say he was promised the opportunity to come back on 1313 before the Disney sale.

I had two big issues (three, actually, but one of them is addressed in a separate post). **One, the crimelord story just made no sense and it seemed to me the writers don't have a grasp on how organized crime actually works.** In no logical universe can someone just declare himself Godfather by moving into the Godfather's home and then expecting everyone to just bow down to him. You not only need significantly more muscle than Boba had (even at the end) to enforce ""protection,"" but you need to...do things. Organized crime is criminal, yes, but it still requires actual WORK from the employees and actual MANAGEMENT from the bosses. This was a story of someone who sat in a chair and then was aghast that no one recognized his authority. By the end, there is some more justification, but even then the ultimate resolution justified his being elected President of Tatooine, or over-Marshall. Not ""Daimyo."" He also chased away the main source of the drug trade, so it's unclear what ""crime"" he wants to be ""boss"" over.

**The second is that this series felt cheap** and lazy in a way that the Mandalorian didn't (or at least successfully obscured). The Twi'leks, for example, look terrible and I won't be convinced otherwise. Suddenly there is NO variation in the length of their headtails and they just look like inert, stiff foam blocks on top of actors' heads. The Gamorreans inexplicably can no longer afford outfits, and consequently they just look like bodypainted fat dudes wearing masks. The costume and vehicle design for the ""mods"" has been extensively discussed elsewhere.

The use of the ""Volume"" got less interesting and there are decisions that just seemed poorly researched. There is no sense of distance among the major cities on Tatooine; they stuck Mos Espa in a giant crater despite it never having been shown that way before. The radical change in Tusken sumptuary rules can't simply be explained by ""different tribes."" The live-action translation of the Pykes was much less interesting than how they were shown in the cartoons. No  headway has been made in improving the ""young Skywalker"" or other CGI effects. This just felt beholden to budget constraints in a way the previous series did not.","so overall i found the series entertaining but not terribly fulfilling the individual character arcs were interesting the dialogue was pretty decent most of the acting was ok

33866,175,3,"train",1,"/r/lotr","The Wheel of Time wasn't nearly as successful as some fans, or Amazon, are trying to claim. The fact that they released their figures in minutes rather than hours like literally every other successful show, just so they could use a larger ""number"" and create the illusion of immense success, only serves as validation for that. I saw someone break down the show's hours viewed compared to other shows streaming at the same time, and apparently it didn't even crack Netflix's top 25. That, for a show with an $80'000'000 budget, *really* isn't great. (And I may be wrong, but I'm fairly certain Amazon hasn't released any viewing figures since its opening week. If that's true, that's incredibly telling and indicative that its viewership dropped off massively - a premiere of a highly popular book adaptation was bound to do well, but it's the audience and viewership it retained afterwards that's truly representative of how well it's actually doing as a show).

There's also the fact that WoT has generated little buzz; I work in a marketing team of 17 nerds who enjoy film and TV (no insult, I'm a big ol' nerd too), and not *one* of them had even *heard* of the show when I mentioned it, never mind watched it - and at this point all 8 episodes had been released. It also had a lukewarm reception at best, with critics finding it average and fan reception being significantly poor; its IMDB rating is currently a 7.2, compared to The Witcher's 8.2, Arcane's 9.1, GoT's 9.4, Vox Machina's 8.7, Shadow and Bone's 7.7, and even Legend of the Seeker's 7.6. It also has a 6.2 finale rating by fans, which is laughably poor. Many shows never sink that low, season after season, and even many die-hard supporters turned on the show after that.

Oh, and as we don't have viewing figures for WoT outside of its opening week, the next best thing to compare is fan interaction online. WoT's opening episode had over 10'000 ratings on IMDB, whereas by the finale it has dropped to 6000. That's very much indicative of a huge drop in viewership/interest. No other current fantasy show has seen such a huge drop on IMDB like that in a single season.

Ultimately, The Wheel of Time did *not* perform very well as both its figures *and* its reception are actually really unimpressive when compared to shows of similar budget, genre, and calibre. It also essentially killed what little hype it might have generated with its almost universally hated finale. I would be unbelievably surprised if its viewership has done anything but plummeted for the second season, and I would bet every penny I have that it won't run for eight seasons as planned. Calling the show ""immensely popular"" is factually incorrect, and all the available information strongly indicates that it heavily underperformed.","the wheel of time wasnt nearly as successful as some fans or amazon are trying to claim the fact that they released their figures in minutes rather than hours like literally every other successful show just so they could use a larger number and create the illusion of immense success only serves as validation for that i saw someone break down the shows hours viewed compared to other shows streaming at the same time and apparently it didnt even crack netflixs top  that for a show with an  budget really isnt great and i may be wrong but im fairly certain amazon hasnt released any viewing figures since its opening week if thats true thats incredibly telling and indicative that its viewership dropped off massively  a premiere of a highly popular book adaptation was bound to do well but its the audience and viewership it retained afterwards thats truly representative of how well its actually doing as a show

Thranduil mostly suspected they were up to some unknown scam. He didn't know who they were or why they popped up in his back yard weenie roast. And they immediately refused to tell him anything at all.

Maybe they were trying to steal or scam some of the Elven-King's treasure? Were they spies? Were they headed to Lake-Town? The Iron Hills? Were they in league with the ""Necromancer"" in Dol Guldur?

Remember, Thorin and the others never even divulged Thorin's name; Thranduil would have immediately known who he was and what he was up to with just a name. (He knew who Thror and Thrain were, as did everyone in those parts, and Thorin's name was probably known.)

Even after hearing back from the raft-elves that Thorin had announced himself in Lake-Town, he and the Master of Lake-Town both suspected that ""Thorin"" was an impostor of some sort, or at the least that he never would actually venture to the mountain.

In other words, they thought the Dwarves were just freeloading as long as they could, and probably trying to run some sort of scam based on this ""treasure"" they were going to get back any minute now. (Maybe get everyone to ""invest"" and then disappear.)

Few, even among the people of Lake-Town, took the dragon at all seriously even after seeing dragon-fire on the mountain.

So instead of sending some troops to drag the Dwarves back to his dungeon, Thranduil was content to let the Dwarves become the Master of Lake-Town's problem (they were expensive to feed and house). and wait for ""Thorin's"" scam to fall apart.

And backing up a bit, the WHOLE reason Thorin would not just tell Thranduil who he was and what he was up to and ask for help was stubbornness, pride, greed and mistrust; he didn't want to share any of the treasure, he knew the price of assistance would be high because they were pretty much entirely helpless, and he didn't trust the elves to stick to a deal anyway.

And, of course, the Elves captured the Dwarves instead of stopping to talk for five damn seconds, so no one was in the mood to negotiate or chat about the situation.","note everything i post is based on the book because the films dont make any sense

There is hardly ever foreshadowing so heavy handed and obvious that it undoubtedly foretells what could easily be described as a major plot twist. We didn't see something spelled out, but yet there were definitely people predicting it long before it was canon.

There are plenty of hints that Reys parents weren't actually nobody  and everyone took Kylos single line in TLJ as God's honest truth without considering the source. It was still true that a Jedi was not defined by their birth or their parents, but by themselves. It just turned out that he was being a dismissive edgelord by telling her that her parents were nobodies. 

So there, TFA and TLJ (yes even despite Kylos single line) both had parts that suggested Reys heritage was significant, and even suggested it was something she was fighting with.

So once a year since college, my dearest friends and I play a LoTR drinking game!

It’s our favorite tradition and I thought I would share the rules with you all!

*(Also please drink responsibly y'all 14 hours is no joke!)*

So first off there are 3 teams! But there were 3 of us so we split that way!You pull characters from a hat, and these are separated into categories with there own rules!

Everyone gets Gandalf, and your Hero/ hobbit sticks with you through all 3 moviesthen they get supplemental characters, that change between the three films.  


First off is **Gandalf**, whome everyone has!

— Every time Gandalf saves everyone’s ass or has a serious wizard moment

Now you draw for your **HERO**

For the hero’s, ANYTIME they kill an orc you drink.

Aragorn- Anytime he’s reluctant to be king or proud to be king/ anytime he speaks in elvish

Legolas- Anytime he doesn’t understand emotions, or states off into the distance

Gimli- anytime he talks about how great dwarves are/ talks about Elves sucking, or his height is referenced

&#x200B;

Next everyone draws a hobbit(s):

Frodo

\- anytime he has the ring on, drink while he’s wearing it (continuously) or anytime he has a romantic moment with Sam

Sam

\- anytime he is reminiscent of the shire, or has a romantic moment with Frodo

Merry & Pippin

\- anytime either of them have shenanigans or say something stupid

&#x200B;

Now everyone draws supplemental characters , these change between movies! But one rule is consistent, if your character dies you finish a full drink!

&#x200B;

**Fellowship:**

Galadriel/ Arwen

\-Anytime Galadriel narrates or speaks in someone’s head. Anytime Either of them speaks in elvish.

Nazgûl

\-Anytime they scream

Boromir

\-Anytime he is tempted by the ring/ his death of course.

&#x200B;

**Two towers**

Theodin

\-anytime he fluctuates from being a hero to an asshole and vice versa

Gollum

\-anytime he chokes on Gollum

Treebeard

\-anytime he stretches a sentence or takes a long time to make a point!

&#x200B;

**Return of the king:**

Theodin

\-anytime he fluctuates between being a hero and an asshole , and when he dies

Nazgul

\-anytime they screech , including the witch king! And when he dies

Gollum

\-anytime he says precious and when he dies !

***Finally an optional rule, is drink anytime someone quotes the movie with the movie !Have fun be safe!***","hello everyone

38856,109,3,"train",1,"/r/lotr","I choose the term white because it includes almost all of Europe (according to most people). Tolkien drew his own mythos from the cultures of the Anglo-Saxons, Norse and pre-industrial England. It was easier to just say white than specifically referring to each culture. Therefore just saying English, as you have said, actually leaves out the other aspects of where Tolkien drew his work from.

Just because there were black people who lived at the same time and same place does not mean that it is automatically made to include these people directly in the story. If I told you to make a story 100yrs ago, or even as much as 1000yrs ago you would not implant people from other cultures in said story because it would not relate directly to the people with whom the story is created to represent, that is just the way the world worked.

It is why African etc. mythologies do not include white people etc., these people were not progressive modernists who like to enforce their worldviews on the past in order to bring it to the standards of the present. There is such a thing as embracing a work for what it is and respecting the time from which it came from in a healthy way you know.

As for your last comment, it's simply a matter of practicality. What is the most practical way of casting actors to best suit the source material? I could ask you the same thing in a different context, why are African people from different parts of Africa cast into Black Panther to portray Wakanda? They are not all from the same area ethnically and yet they are all cast to portray the same fictional space.

If what you're saying is to only cast people who specifically represent a certain ethnic group then I'm afraid to say it but it is not possible. There is no one alive today with the same genetic composition as someone who lived 1000yrs ago, and so you would completely destroy adaptations as a whole if you seriously implemented something like that.","i choose the term white because it includes almost all of europe according to most people tolkien drew his own mythos from the cultures of the anglosaxons norse and preindustrial england it was easier to just say white than specifically referring to each culture therefore just saying english as you have said actually leaves out the other aspects of where tolkien drew his work from

39953,319,3,"train",1,"/r/lotr","I tend to corral the things I hate in the films into three broad categories.

• *The first (and, to me, most unforgivable) category* is the manipulation of the actual characters to the point they no longer resemble the version from the book. The prime example of this is the moment in *Fellowship* when Aragorn catches Sam & Frodo dragging the boat out into the river near the Falls of Rauros, and then **agrees that they should go on into Mordor alone!!! KNOWING GOLLUM IS FOLLOWING THEM?!?**

There is absolutely no universe in which the Aragorn from the books would conscion this. None. It is madness, and Aragorn well knows it. But Jackson wanted Aragorn to the Perfect Fantasy Warrior, and so the breaking of the Fellowship couldn't be the spastic fuck-up it is in the book. Aragorn had to be In Charge. At that point, more than any other, this is no longer the character from the book. Period. This is the guy who kills the Mouth of Sauron under a flag of parlay at the Gates of Mordor, not Elessar the Elfstone.

But all the characters suffer similar abuse. The hobbits are cowardly, comic-relief children, Gimli is Yosemite Sam, Legolas is a pretty douche with slick hair and bad dialogue and Gandalf is a largely ineffectual cranky old man who seems to come back *weaker* as Gandalf the White.

*• The second category* is filtering the story through the eyes of a 16-year-old boy. Much of the book is subtle, lyrical and beautiful, filled with the poetry of sadness. Everything Jackson changes or adds becomes loud and stupid. The absolute best example of this is Pippin at the well in the guard room in Moria. In the book, he picks up a pebble - a universal instinct most people would have to fight - and drops it in. A *long* time later there's a tiny splash... then the hammer begins banging in the depths. It's subtle, quiet, and much more scary than the absurd version we're served in the film.

That version? Pippin ingores the reading of the book to molest a dead body (not a small thing in Tolkien's world), knocks the helmeted skull off and... **CLANG-BANG-BANG-BANG-CLANG-BANG-CLANG-BANG-CLANG.** Forever. It's loud. It's stupid. it's obnoxious. The adolescents in the theater loved it.

But everything Jackson fooled with has the same tone. Loud. Stupid. Overdone. The orcs swarming up the walls like spiders. Saruman's super-hero Uruk-Hai. The terrible, *terrible* Battle of the Wizards. The ridiculous stoner humor layered over anything having to do with pipe weed. The Council of the Wise squabbling like a bunch of brats and Yosemite Sam trying to kill the Ring with his axe. Sam drowning for an hour. Every single damned thing in the Battle of Helm's Deep. Everything with the Oathbreakers. Removing the Scouring of the Shire because he wanted a Big, Happy Ending!

*• The last category* is simple What-the-Fuckery? Things that changed that make no sense, in-universe or out. The example I always bring up with friends is Merry and Pippin barely knowing Frodo in the film. It makes them rascals for essentially crashing the party, but the bigger picture is an utter confusion as to why these two would EVER go off with Frodo and Sam? If you ignore the books and go strictly by the relationship presented on screen, there is literally NO REASON Merry and Pippin would go to Rivendell, much less on the quest of the Fellowship. They barely know Frodo at all, except by name.

Then there's the inexplicable decision to have everyone kind of assume Moria was still open for business, and then be surpised to find it an abandoned tomb. I honestly can't figure that. It's as if Chicago went dark with no comings or goings for 200 years and everyone just assumed they were doing fine. It's so bizarre.

There's so much more. Pointed ears on the dwarves. Pointed ears on the *hobbits!* (I'm of the 'Elves didn't have pointed ears either' school, but I know there's an argument either way. But C'MON!) Narsil being regifted to Aragorn as Anduril without him apparently having known it still existed (Huh? Why?) Frodo sending Sam away in favor of Gollum. I mean, *Two Towers* is just a shitshow, top-to-bottom, but what the hell was that?

Gandalf losing to the Lord of the Nazgul. That really made me angry. He might be the Witch King of Angmar, but Gandlaf is a *Maia*. Gandalf was set against Sauron, not his servants, and this entire scene displays not just lack of understanding, but actual contempt for Tolkien's world and works.

I could go on. And on.

36478,122,3,"train",1,"/r/lotr","It’s relevant as a point of comparison based on the nature of Tolkien’s objections and how they apply to PJs version of LOTR as well as the Amazon series. Tolkien was more concerned with missing significant thematic elements than just missing plot points. That’s why he would prefer to leave out Helms Deep (a battle between men) in favor of the Ents battling Saruman (a battle of trees against industrialization). The danger of industrialization was a major theme of the books. To his credit, PJ included both. 

Looking at another theme that PJ got horribly wrong, Tolkien would almost certainly want the battle of Pelennor Fields shortened in favor of including the Scouring. I understand why the Scouring was cut, and it makes sense for a movie, but it’s critical to the book because it demonstrates the development of the hobbits into leaders and also demonstrates that no one escapes the impact of war. In the movie, the residents of the Shire appear to be entirely oblivious to what happened. Tolkien would have been horrified.

Now look at ROP. If the reported terms of the agreement are accurate, Amazon is prohibited from changing written canon in the material they have access to and they cannot change the nature or themes of the story when making additions.

I’ll grant that Amazon may be pushing the limits of the agreement, but they are far more constrained than PJ was. The time compression in particular has a high risk of misrepresenting important events. So the letter is relevant to any adaptation, but I don’t think it’s useful to apply to a single adaptation without also pointing out how the others went wrong. It creates the impression that Amazon could produce something that would satisfy Tolkien, when the reality is, based on every other adaptation, that they probably can’t.","its relevant as a point of comparison based on the nature of tolkiens objections and how they apply to pjs version of lotr as well as the amazon series tolkien was more concerned with missing significant thematic elements than just missing plot points thats why he would prefer to leave out helms deep a battle between men in favor of the ents battling saruman a battle of trees against industrialization the danger of industrialization was a major theme of the books to his credit pj included both

I’d also say that Christopher Tolkien’s name gets brought up a lot in this forum as if he’d hate this new project but positively reviewed Jackson’s work. Of course, he had very few kind things to say about Jackson, or that project in general, and reading what he has to say he comes off a tad bitter. To him, Middle Earth was more real than any of us, so it probably felt like someone rummaging through his personal diary for all the salacious parts. He wanted to omit Helm’s Deep (battle of the Hornburg) entirely! Honestly, I’d want to see his LotR. One that is less war and spectacled centered, but the one we got was fine by me.

Tolkien and his son would have been impossible to please on this point, so I think we shouldn’t set our sights so high.

Both have no intention of following JRRT's canon, but use its recognizable setting, names and symbolism as a space to create their own story. And while Boorman uses them in conjunction with his own system of themes and symbols to create something different, what we have seen of ROP went the exact opposite way, reusing ideas and design from PJ's movies, playing it safe, making it palatable and calling to the nostalgia of the trilogy instead of the sensitivity of the watchers.

You may not agree with Boorman's choices and think of his creation as hokey, but what he proposes has an artistic intent, obvious symbolism and themes, where ROP is blantantly not a work of art meant to create emotions, but a product to be consumed, which is, in my opinion, the worst possible corruption of a work of art. 

That being said, Boorman's script was never intended to become a movie, he was told to write it by his producer, while he wanted to make his Excalibut.

Like Jesus Christ from the very moment episode started, you could FEEL Rodriguez in every shot. He's alright, but God, it was all over the place.

And there were a bit of very awkward shots that kinda spoiled the flow of the episode. Like Mando just casually walking away from still alive droid that just almost killed him. That took away the immersion completely in the moment. Then the Freetown folk started shooting at the rancor they saw Boba was riding so it was friendly, just why?

And then overall I think that Cad was brought in for fanservice reasons because there wasn't any meaningful outcome from him. Yeah a few banter shots with Boba but... was that just it?

Now I wasn't complaining about Mando being in the show before but the way they ended it, I am now convinced that it's just a connection show for Mando season 3. Because it ended on Mando just flying away. Not even on Boba. It's just this part specifically rubbed wrong on me.

I hope season 2 is going to be less of a connection show but more of standalone story. And I do hope Rodriguez gets the boot because... well, yeah. His episodes are my least favourite in the show simply because of how they were filmed.

Also after credits scene just came out of nowhere. I mean I'm glad Cobb survives because that just rocks but wish they connected it more. Hell Boba didn't even have contact with the mod guy outside of flashbacks in the show. It wouldn't have hurt for him to have a conversation with the guy in present day, at least.

EDIT: Also one more complaint for director - the scene where Fennec kills of the leaders was just so underwhelming it should be criminal. She's cool and deserves a better scene than that. It just didn't have logic whatsoever. Like how did she do all this, how did she get in?

2. You cannot boil such a complex concept as love or beauty down to a single perspective. Either can mean much more than one thing. 

3. You really do not understand what I mean by love. You can love something in many different ways, I believe the Greeks have something like 8 words for love that all mean something different. Your entire argument/discussion/comment thread hinges completely upon a disconnect between love and beauty in the context of the 30s. 

Everything that you've said is dependent upon the concept that, unlike the modern concept of beauty in which people fall in love with someone they find beautiful, which could be misconstrued as superficiality, Gimli only respected and revered Galadriel as beautiful because he takes what you call the ""30s"" perspective on the concept of beauty. 

There is no one concept of beauty in the 30s and a different concept entirely in the modern sense. Beauty has meant several different things simultaneously throughout history. 

First off, desiring someone's hair has many different insinuations that transcend era specific sociocultural norms. One is sexual, in which someone is reminded of the body of the person to whom the hair belongs, as hair is an extension of the body. Another is sentimentality, reminding the person of the personality that the hair belonged to or the concept of the person. Gimli's desire for a loch of hair based entirely on the concept of beauty falls more into the latter (although there are more than two) because he respects Galadriel and wouldn't be creepily masturbating to her hair. Regardless, the sentimentality of being reminded of a person whom he respects could, very easily, be regarded as love whether on the basis of beauty or respect. Both can exist simultaneously. And from what you have said the two are relatively intertwined. 

So... What exactly are you arguing? That Gimli does not love Galadriel? What is love? Who are you to define it so suffocatingly narrowly? As abstract a concept that love is how can you say that he does not love her in any of the 8 potential Greek ways? If one can love a country or the land they live on, nature, a people, a culture, a concept... why couldn't Gimli love Galadriel in any capacity? 

No one said anything about superficiality but you. You claimed that beauty in the 30s was not superficial. **That did not need to be said given I only claimed that Gimli loved Galadriel for her beauty.** That isn't any more superficial than respecting her for her beauty. Respect and love are also very similar yet abstract concepts. 

You think you're clever but everyone and their mother has heard the bit about the three lochs of hair compared with Feanor's denied request for one. You really didn't need to be rude about it. 

>beauty had much more value 

Have you seen modern media? Beauty means almost everything to everyone. I think you mean it had more depth, to which I'd say... what kind of beauty? Beauty has always been superficial to almost every degree, whether people show reverence to it or not.","are you  years or older 

 you cannot boil such a complex concept as love or beauty down to a single perspective either can mean much more than one thing 

 you really do not understand what i mean by love you can love something in many different ways i believe the greeks have something like  words for love that all mean something different your entire argumentdiscussioncomment thread hinges completely upon a disconnect between love and beauty in the context of the s 

everything that youve said is dependent upon the concept that unlike the modern concept of beauty in which people fall in love with someone they find beautiful which could be misconstrued as superficiality gimli only respected and revered galadriel as beautiful because he takes what you call the s perspective on the concept of beauty 

there is no one concept of beauty in the s and a different concept entirely in the modern sense beauty has meant several different things simultaneously throughout history 

first off desiring someones hair has many different insinuations that transcend era specific sociocultural norms one is sexual in which someone is reminded of the body of the person to whom the hair belongs as hair is an extension of the body another is sentimentality reminding the person of the personality that the hair belonged to or the concept of the person gimlis desire for a loch of hair based entirely on the concept of beauty falls more into the latter although there are more than two because he respects galadriel and wouldnt be creepily masturbating to her hair regardless the sentimentality of being reminded of a person whom he respects could very easily be regarded as love whether on the basis of beauty or respect both can exist simultaneously and from what you have said the two are relatively intertwined

>Star Wars has always been about the characters since the start.

Exactly, we see Luke and Han's arc, their character growth, progress, relationships and actions fill out what we know as the Original Trilogy of Star Wars films. 

It's hard to describe, and they both feed into each other, but a pretty easy way to illustrate is don't weaken a story or a story's impact just so you can have a character you like show up again. Everything a character does needs to be for the good of the story, and if you can get that right, everything else will follow. It doesn't have to be some huge, entangled, complicated plot.

For example: a ton of people (myself included), think Ahsoka making it out of Twilight of the Apprentice, especially since there was no real way out of that, was a huge blow to the significance of her and Vader's encounter, the tension of the show in general, their arcs as characters and the type of person she is (throwing herself into danger for the sake of her friends, the old sacrificing herself for the new generation), and also keeps begging the question on where she is in the OT. But because Filoni can't bear to see anything bad happen to her, she lives (and almost damn near breaks the universe with the World between Worlds shenanigans to justify it) and it all ends up being a nothingburger.","fanfiction is noncanon fiction written by fans not professional writers hired by the studio to make more content so i dont really understand that statement

29614,141,3,"train",1,"/r/lotr","As someone whose favorite book of all time is The Hobbit and actually (unironically) enjoyed PJ's film trilogy, I personally wouldn't recommend skipping the book and just watching the movies as an alternative.

While one's personal opinion and enjoyment of The Hobbit trilogy is certainly up to the viewer, it cannot be denied that the films and the book are both very different entities. While both more or less share the same story, the book was a simple and easy-to-follow children's book, while the films were much larger in scale and focused more on being a spiritual prequel to the Lord of the Rings instead of being its own thing like the original novel did.

I'd also like to include that The Hobbit book is actually quite an easy read compared to other Tolkien works like LotR and especially The Silmarillion. It was written as a book for children and reads more like fairytale than an epic like its sequel, so you would certainly have quite an easy time reading this book and maybe even finish it in no time!

Of course, if you're not really a reader (which is perfectly alright), as someone here already suggested, you could try listening to an audiobook version of the story. There are many great ones to choose from (including one read by Gollum himself, Andy Serkis), but I'd personally recommend checking out Bluefax's reading as it feels like an audio drama complete with distinct voices for each character, sound effects, and even the utilization of Howard Shore's phenomenal score from the movies.

Though, if none of these work for you, then maybe if you'd be interested, you could check out the Rankin Bass animated film that was released back in 1977 for although it both cut/changed certain elements from the book, it does at least better match the tone of the book than PJ's trilogy did.

Of course, if none of these really work, then I guess you could watch the movies instead as an alternative.

These are just my personal suggestions of course and in the end, it's really up to your best judgement. I do at least hope that this could be of help in any way for your decision on how to experience The Hobbit, and I would also like to apologize for this rather lengthy response (I absolutely love all things The Hobbit, both book and adaptations, so I definitely want you to have the best possible experience when reading/listening/watching this magical story).

Can't say I really enjoyed anything outside of Episode 5 & 6.  
Robert Rodriguez shouldn't be allowed to touch another SW thing ever again. He gave us CW Superhero level of stupid good guys in action.  


A few things:

\- Cad Bane should've been in the show from the first episode. It should've been a growing rivalry where we continue to see Bane be a complete god tier villian. (instead the introduced him at the end of last episode and killed him at the end of this episode \*\*Yes Ik he may not be dead dead but still bad writing, if I hadn't seen Clone Wars this would've been SO weird.\*\*)

\- The show should've focused more on Boba growing older and possibly being off his edge. That way, instead of us watching him struggle in every fight and being like ""Wtf is this stupid action?"" it made sense and added more weight. That at the very very end we can see Boba struggling in his fight, knocked down, Bane approaching, and when he wins it feels like a major triumph. Instead of Boba just losing every fight, needing help and then finally remembering he is not an idiot.

\- The Spy Kids shit needs to go. So out of place in Star Wars.

\- I guess i'm fine with Vanth surviving.

\- So.... The end of Mando S2, with Grogu going to Luke is just... undone. Back to Adventures with Kid! I thought at least \*something\* interesting would occur with Luke being like ""Okay fine take both, no attachments was the old jedi way and stupid. I loved my father and that love brought peace to the galaxy."" but nah... just ""Here's the kid back""

\- Why was Mando holding Grogu to his chest IN A WARZONE!!>!>!?!?!

\- I personally would like to see Grogu age up. I understand he likely won't for a while, and I get why. But for story purposes I'm kinda tired of 2/4 major enemies in this episode being taken out by a cutesy little child holding his hand out. (droid 1 & rancor.. droid 2 & cad)

\- I know the darksaber stuff will be elaborated on way more in the next Mando season but it really just felt like he did nothing with it the entire show.. Episode 5 was very cool with him and it tho

\- Why did they need to fight in the middle of the city to protect the citizens? Were the Pikes going to start murdering innocents? that hardly makes any sense. Pulling the action away would be far better for the population.

\- Mando willing to die for Boba was cool (and I get somewhere it could be ""I don't have my Mando group anymore, and I don't have Grogu so why not die) but that plot point needed FAR MORE emphasize, it was super odd Mando just being like ""Yup okay i'll die""

\- I am 10000% convinced you could've shot this episode with the same script and different director and it would've been 1000x better. The action of them never taking cover, barely ever taking high ground, and being constantly caught in the same area firing back and forth was so horribly done and took a lot of tension out.

\- Rancor entrance and fight scenes were cool enough I suppose.

\- Running away in a straight line with no cover in open streets.... okay.

\- So they finally took time to answer the question I've been wondering this entire series. Why Boba wants to be a Crime Lord on Tatooine... anddddd ""This is my city""..... are you fucking kidding me? How does that make any sense? Become the Sheriff then... the MAYOR! Not the fucking crime lord.... His motivation for that job was so dumb. Also... at the end does he give up the position??? Because of the respect he earned?!?!? Like... the fighting 1000 enemies wasn't what did it... it was the BOWING TO PEOPLE that got Boba to realize he doesn't want the job.

Anyways, some real nitpick stuff in my comments, but I think this show suffered massively on the directing front, not having a major focus, being all over the place.","welp the show certainly ended

If these movies were actually planned out fully we should've seen Rey's affinity with the dark side through her relation to Palpatine foreshadowed from the very beginning.  Instead the only time we get foreshadowing about anything dark side related to Rey is in the final movie, which also makes it pretty obvious that this decision was made on the fly.  

It makes me sad honestly because these movies were such a mess with each one have a completely different direction which just ruins the flow of the entire trilogy.  I would love to see these movies be improved and made better by other Star Wars content like The Bad Batch, The Mandalorian, and Ahsoka but I just don't know how much can realistically be done.","yeah thats why i feel as if they will never be able to fix or dramatically improve the sequels as they did with prequels  with the prequels there actually was still a planned out story and characters actually had somewhat fleshed out arcs and even if you didnt enjoy the story you cant deny that the story made sense and had a certain logical flow to it iirc he waited to make the prequels until the special effectscgi was good enough to realize what his vision

Man this show had its ups and downs, but I'd say more downs. Just some moronic decisions all around. Also, I get Boba trying to redeem himself but he was so weird in this, some of his dialogue was downright awful. I could not stand the pointless Space Greasers. They didn't fit with the planet and I'm not sure if they even fit with Star Wars. Cobb Vanth was also shot in the shoulder to make it look like he lived then said he was killed in cold blood only to be in a Bacta tank at the end? Cad Bane was introduced way to late to be a meaningful villain for the show and the Pykes were not intimidating at all. The voice for the mayor was terrible. Just use the Ithorian voice and use subtitles. It sounds way cooler and half of kids now watch shows with Subs anyway. WHY DOES EVERY POPULAR STARWARS VILLAIN HAVE TO BECOME A GOOD GUY?  Killing Jennifer Beals in a poorly cut almost pointless way was a mistake. Also, dont get me started on Boba not getting revenge himself after finding out it was the Pykes who killed the Tuskens. Ming is cool but it shouldn't of been her Character. Boba also flew to his palace to get the Rancor instead of the Slave 1. Loved the show though, just lots of stupid stuff.

From the very first scene of Luke talking with uncle Owen about his dad, there was a mystery there. And sure, Ben gave his explanation but clearly Owen didn’t approve of Ben all that much and we know next to nothing about Ben at that point (if watched in release order). 

In Empire, Luke and Leia kiss but in the same movie Yoda says there’s another hope for the galaxy, so clearly setting up…. Something? But it’s left open and return of the Jedi pays it off pretty well if you ask me.

TFA doesn’t set up anything other than Snoke is a bigger bad than kylo, and in TLJ Kylo gives a pretty convincing answer as to who Rey’s parents are. The mystery of Snoke is still there but it almost seemed like they were going to bury it with his death, and Rey’s parentage was given what we thought was a controversial pay off but a pat off nonetheless.

Fast forward to TROS. They give Snoke possibly the most half assed explanation not to be outdone by Emperor Palpatine “somehow returning” 

The set up and pay off is noticeably off in TROS as compared to its previous two movies. The reason? There wasn’t even a thought of planning the three together and they didn’t even leave it open in any way. 

George Lucas was clearly thinking trilogy after empire, and a new hope leaves the mystery open enough for sequels to execute it well.

From what I’ve read, the two showrunners are total LotR nerds with a background in writing and English lit who were huge underdogs to be given stewardship of this project. 

And then to see all the care they’ve put into the production design (starting with the title reveal, which was severely criticized for being bad CGI when it was actually all done with practical effects) as well as the involvement of both WETA and Howard Shore… I really don’t get that this will be a sterile, no-passion series.

 Dialogue was stiff, plot points were convenient and easy, and the action was so dry and inconsequential. It was literally: good guys and bad guys fight, bad guys get upper hand, good guys have a moment on the ground where they're definitely beat, good guys get saved. 

It works once, not once every 10 minutes. Also what in the hell was with Fennec just explaining the plot in a dry tone at the beginning? Felt like a book report more than a sit-rep. 

Overall it's what I would expect from a Mando spin off, but I think it was a big mistake having two BDH/ Filoni episodes, then passing the ball back to Rodriguez for the finale. It made the whole show feel like a stepping stone for Mandalorian as apposed to a standalone series for a beloved character. 

5/10, lots of wasted potential with some great moments throughout.","yeah this was pretty rough for me i have no issues taking boba in a different direction it makes sense in a lot of ways and im excited to see him develop i just dont think rodriguez has the chops for a project like this

An Elf will be more reliant on the physical, to be sure, but the difference between Elf and Man is far more subtle. (Also pretty hard to compare Elves to, say, Men, with a Balrog example... only Elves fight Balrogs, as only Men slay Dragons - that isn't to say *only* Men can kill a dragon, so perhaps a Man could slay a Balrog - hard to say). Anyway, Elves are generally better, we agree: but that doesn't mean stupidly better.

Morgoth is big, but small enough to plant his foot on Fingolfin's neck.

Between Sauron and Balrogs, it seems 10-12 feet tall is a good estimate.
