* Fennec Shand had a whole monogloue explaining the premise of the show, the setting, and context of the “war”. Should have just had her look right into the camera and say “previously on Boba Fett”. Horrible.
* Everyone shooting at the droids nonstop was just dumb. Like, stop?
* Kad Bane did literally nothing. He looked and sounded amazing when he was introduced, but his presence amounted to nothing. 
* Boba saying “we’re doomed if the Freetown people doesn’t show up” never made any sense. It’s a rural desert town of about 10 people, and a speed of 7 randos showed up. Hardly an army, but I’m more surprised how Boba and Mando expected them to be sufficient reinforcements.

""No, Luke. I am your father."" is so engrained in pop culture that I think people overlook why having his father turn out to be the villain works for Luke in a way it doesn't for a lot of other characters the evil dad trope is just slapped onto. Luke and the audience are consistently told that he's a lot like his father, and given the great hero Obi-Wan leads him to believe Anakin was, being like his father is something that Luke sees as a good thing. To find out that his father is Darth Vader, and that he actually was that great hero before but still turned to the dark side, is a major blow to Luke. Now it's potentially a very bad thing that he's so much like his father and makes him question his own ability to resist the dark side.

Rey, by contrast, was always alone, and feeding herself and the audience the belief that her parents will someday come back and that they must have left her behind on Jakku for a reason. The mystery around her sets her up as someone coming from something special, or at the very least that she's someone who wants to be, who wants to feel that they have some place in everything. To be forced to confront that her parents were simply nobodies who sold her off is a major blow to her, because now she feels truly alone and that there is no place for her anywhere, which makes Kylo's offer of friendship and destroying the painful past actually somewhat tempting.

Having an evil relative works for Luke in a way it doesn't for Rey or at lot of other characters without similar set-up, because there is no emotional weight or thematic importance to it. There's no reason in Rey's story to care that Palpatine is her grandfather other than the script says she does.

I've been thinking a lot about this just because I'm part of the My Hero Academia fandom and there's a lot of people there who think the protagonist Midoriya is going to turn out to be the son of the big villain All For One...pretty much only because it's known that the author loves Star Wars.

2) it’s biology afaik

3) because it’s scary (cinema). 
Edit: the books describe it as screechy so it fits. 

4) iirc the nazgul are ‘afraid’ of water yes. But this could be purely from the movie. But I’m fairly sure it’s also in the books.

6) cinematic effect I think. It shows the evilness of the blade. 
Edit: it happens in the book too and its because the blades are bound to the shadow form of the nazgul who are not part of this world hence the blade isnt either. 

7) as explained elsewhere she is much lighter. Also she could be more skilled

8) afraid yes. Hence the reluctant crossing. Compared to the other scene this stream is also not so deep. 

9) this is a long story but part of it is that the Noldorian Elves are doomed by the deeds of their ancestor, Feanor. But it could also be part of Eru’s masterplan (the supreme being that creates this world)
Edit: this plan entails that the elves who are immortal and resistant to change would teach men and then fade from the world.

Have any of their live actions been objectively good other than Cinderella and the first Maleficent?

A lot of them are straight up aggressively awful, like Beauty and the Beast, Aladin and the second and third Star Wars reboots. 

They are still making bank, and regardless of how bad the products are, people won't stop consuming them. You say the Star Wars movies weren't profitable, but look at the box office numbers.

They've focus grouped it to death realizing that this ""culture war"" bullshit is highly profitable. I'm extremely left, and I'm saying this bc I see the mega corp TM for what it is. I don't believe the company literally being charged for racially segregating employees by race, and charged with rampant misogyny gives a shit about representation.

They KNOW they're pissing off their entrenched fan bases, but also KNOW that the fans are going to predominantly watch anyways. They don't care, bc they already know they have that group in pocket anyways.

They're deliberately making moves via faux woketivism by trying to intentionally generate controversy. Why? They're trying to get an audience that wouldn't otherwise consume the media to do so as a ""teams politics"" statement. 

I KNOW that they're not doing this genuinely, otherwise movies like Mulan, Black Panther or Shang-Chi would have had diverse casting. Not just pointing out the monogamous races in these movies, but the lack of LGBTQ+ rep, religious rep, social justice advocacy (just... everything wrong with shooting Mulan in the province where the Uighur concentration camps are and knowing that the outsourced labour is being fulfilled by that slave labour) highlights they don't actually care if it's not profitable.

That's also why they are constantly treating actors from marginalized groups, esp. women of colour as disposable. The actress that played Rose in the new starwars movies was harrased and doxxed non-stop with what was equivalent to a green stop sign put up by Disney for example  look at how Netflix has treated the marginalized actors from Cowboy Bebop, and the Witcher.

These adaptations are chronically bad, bc they know they can get away with being bad. The money and effort goes into producing, and advertising. The rest is a hollow, shitty CGI fest that reads like bad fan fiction that undercuts the intent, themes, stories etc. of the source material. 

Think back to how desperately people defended the fem ghost buster remake. Think about how bad and low quality it was. That didn't read to me as a passion project. Ghost Busters fan largely watched it begrudgingly, and people who felt they were ""showing the sexists"" went to go watch it when they wouldn't have otherwise.

The only way to end this shit is to not engage with it. Don't pay for it. Don't defend it.

Adaptations are always ways to re-introduce stories to the current age we live in. To have darker-skinned heroic characters is not that far of a stretch, especially considering the global village the world has become, since 1937.

2.  This was a design choice by the film makers to show to the audience how hobbits have hairy, leathery feet, but they are not necessarily large.

3. The Nazgûl are wraiths -- undead spectres flitting between the realms of shadow and light, and in the films, the screeching serves two purposes: to incite dread and suspense in the audience and to portray communication between the Nazgûl themselves.

4.  This doesn't happen in the book. Farmer Maggot hides them in a wagon and drives them to the ferry where they run into Merry who takes them across to Buckland. In general, though, the Nazgûl seem cautious of the natural elements because the exist in the realm unseen for the most part and aren't really part of the natural world anymore.

5.  The Wizards' powers are mostly channeled through their staves and the words of power (speaking spells, literally). Think of them like tools or weapons. The staves also serve as their badges of office so to speak, and when Gandalf the White returned as the head of the Wizards' Order, after Helm's Deep, he broke Saruman's staff, expelling him from the Istari and destroying his main tool for magic.

6.  The Morgul Blade is a weapon of dark sorcery made by the Witch King. It was made of dark magic and its purpose seemed to be to turn Frodo into a wraith, to draw him into the realm of shadows. As to why it vanished, I believe that in the books, Aragorn discovered it in the early morning light and it being a blade of shadows dissipated from the light and left only the hilt.

7. In the books, they meet the elf lord Glorfindel, not Arwen, and he gives Frodo his horse to cross the Bruinen more comfortably, but the company all arrived at the Ford more or less at once. That being said, and I am by no means an equestrian, but I imagine Arwen being the horse's mistress, probably could have handled it better than Aragorn, who was unfamiliar to the horse as far as we know.

8. They were more afraid of this river in particular because it marked the border of Rivendell, the realm of Elrond who wielded one if the three elven rings, Vilya, the Ring of Air. The border, as they found out, was protected by the magic of Elrond and Gandalf combined, the latter himself wielding the Ring of Fire, Narya. Though they did not know it, the Nazgûl were up against two powerful bearers of the elven rings, one in effect the de facto leader of the Noldorin remnant, and the other a wizard who was actually a spiritual being sent by the Valar (gods) to aid the Free Peoples against Sauron.

9. At the end of the First Age, with the defeat of Sauron's master, Morgoth, the Valar commanded the Elves to leave Middle-earth and return to Aman, the Undying Lands, and over time, the elves were spiritually called to cross the seas and pass into the Blessed Realm, and this actually ended up working in conjunction with the defeat of Sauron and the advent of the Dominion of Men in Middle-earth. The time of the Dominion of the Elves was long passed, and the Elven Rings lost their power with the destruction of the One.

10. This one is lore heavy. Before the Sun and the Moon, there was no light in Middle-earth save the Stars, which were made by the Valier Queen Varda, whose specialty is in light. However, in Valinor (domain of the Valar in Aman), her sister Yavanna sang into being two holy Trees that produced light for the Blessed Realm. Telperion the Silver and Laurelin the Golden. Eventually Morgoth killed the Trees, but Yavanna was able to save a flower of Telperion and a fruit of Laurelin. These she gave to Manwë, King of the Valar and the Earth, who hallowed them, and then Aulë the Smith created vessels for them and Varda set them in the sky. Two maiar (spiritual vassals of the Valar) were selected to chariot them, Arien the Sun, and Tilion the Moon. The point here being that the light of the Sun and Moon, especially the Sun, were incredibly holy.

Now the Orcs were allegedly elves corrupted by Morgoth, and as servants of Darkness, the holy light of the Sun was painful to them, and in fact, it would turn trolls into stone. So the armies of the enemy relied on their masters to create covers of darkness to protect them from the holy Sun.

 11. I believe this is primarily a film decision to try and portray the connection between Frodo and the Ring. In the book, no one tried to hit the Ring with a weapon at the Council of Elrond (it was also with Frodo pretty much the whole time).

 12.  Quenya, the high elven language. Others seem to have provided a translation of the incantation.

 13. This also wasn't really in the book (there were trolls, but they did not come into the room). Frodo was actually attacked by the spear of an Orc Chieftain who was summarily beheaded by Aragorn. As for the movie scene, maybe the light wasn't strong enough or something. Probably a continuity error, to be honest.

I hope all of this helps answer those questions!","sauron forged the ring with part of his soul his feä and when the ring was removed his soul was basically split and so he vacated his body to preserve himself for without the ring he was disconnected from his power and no longer whole

I really don't care about them adding ""diverse"" characters so long as it makes sense within the story. What does worry me though is them forcing it into the story and making it the focal point of any of the plot.

Black female dwarf? Fine with me, although hopefully they at least try and explain it somehow.

Black elf? Less explainable but I'll accept it. 

However if they had for example an LGBT love story, especially if it's a major part of the show, that would absolutely not be suitable for Tolkien's work. Not only because he was a serious Catholic but because it doesn't fit the theme of the story. 

I know there's probably a mixed race love story between the black elf and a white human, but hopefully that works in the context of the story rather than being the focal point of the show or focusing on ""overcoming differences"" or some other similar message that tries to link it to the real world.

In 2001 Fellowship had a record breaking 700+ CG shots, two years later for Return of the King they had an absolutely staggering 2,000+ CG shots. It’s impossible to tell these epic fantasy stories using practical effects - there’s magic and massive ancient cities and huge battles and giant creatures that do not exist in real life. They’re certainly not going to go back to using stop-motion animation. 

For the most part, this trailer looks to be *aesthetically* a step back in the right direction after the mixed bag that was the Hobbit trilogy. And from what we’ve all heard, they’ve shot a lot of the show on location and have built a ton of new sets and costumes for the show.

* So at a certain point Din drops the Darksaber after using it on and then falling from the giant droid and doesn't pick it up before he runs off. I'm going to take it that was an oversight and he has it with him now. 
* Maybe I'm wrong but it felt like that Boba vs Bane fight wouldn't have been more exciting and active had it been in a movie or animated. All said and done it was quite bland. I found it odd for Boba to be reaching for his rifle and such after getting shot and laying on the ground given he still had his hand blaster in his holster. 
* The CW Cyberpunk 2077 kids are still a joke. Don't get me wrong, they are very Filoni and even Lucas, but they are the kiddy and overly campy aspect I have never enjoyed about Star Wars. 
* That mid-credits scene is really weird. Don't get me wrong, I expected him to live by why tease it like that? It makes you assume something will come of that. I would assume he's the perfect guy to be the street walking, handshaking, face of Boba's government like Boba was saying they needed while the people were saluting him but how does that warrant that mid-credit tease? 

The series as a whole was really average, in fact disappointing given who the main character is. I'm not one of those people who needed him to pick up where he left off and be a low-word-count hyper badass deadliest bounty hunter like some other people who can't get over him not being how they imagined when they played with his action figures. I'd be more open to that if we didn't already have Din who is exactly what Boba was. 

The show really survived on three things, the Mando season 2.5 bits, the flashbacks and the Rancor in the finale. I'm pretty shocked how weak their story was for Boba Fett's own show. Hell, they effectively only had Boba's story in 5.5 episodes out of 7 and still nearly half of it was walk and talks and boring politics. 

I'll be honest, after this season and where Boba and Mos Espa is at, I'm good with there being no season 2. I'm sand planet-ed out, Boba can only do so much in the sandbox that is Tatooine/Mos Espa and he needs to talk less which for a show like was set up like it was, doesn't really work. 

Lastly, no, there was no problems with nostalgia or fan service. Anyone who thinks that doesn't seem to understand this is just another Filoni show, directly tied to all his others, where in places that it makes sense you see Leia, Obi Wan, Qui Gon, Yoda, Lando, Boba, Tarkin and Vader. Grogu is a force sensitive (former Jedi padawan it seems?) and he calls out to the force for a teacher... guess who is literally the only Jedi teacher in the galaxy at that point in time? And guess what he's doing? Yup, it's Luke and he's building his Academy. It lines up perfectly. Cad Bane showing up... why wouldn't the Pike's hire the #1 bounty hunter in the galaxy and the only person to have beaten Boba Fett when they're going up against Boba Fett? I mean FFS people, stop throwing around ""nostalgia"" and ""fan service"" so much. You clearly don't know what they mean or when they actually apply. Imagine this show is animated and you will see this is all 100% classic Filoni, lining up perfectly with what he's done in the past. He knows when to and how to use characters and stories from the OT, PT, comics, legends and now ST in order to make Star Wars feel like it's all connected. All while almost always doing it in a way that makes total sense, isn't forced and doesn't make the universe feel too small.","a solid if not somewhat underwhelming finale given who the main character is the rancor scenes really elevated this episode without them

On just the nostalgia/re introduction of old characters factor alone I am thankful for Book of Boba but there are some issues that kinda drag the whole experience down. Felt really poorly paced and nothing really happened until the finale, the characters were pretty bland, and I gotta be honest there was A LOT of cringe. It started off strong where I was really engaged in the beginning seeing the flashbacks of his time with the raiders and his re introduction into the cities underworld/mafia life, but man did it just grind to a halt in the middle. I get you have to establish other players but Boba didn’t even do anything for so many episodes, he felt like a side character in his own show. The sudden shift to legit two Mandolorian episodes didn’t help that at all and while I really liked the Luke/Grogu and Mando plots, it’s the Book of BOBA FETT come on lol. Probably the worst scene in the entire series was the Mod’s bike “chase” (and I use chase very lightly here it visually looked so awkward), and a lot of the fights were not well choreographed. 

Some of the best parts of the series for me were the Tuscan flashbacks with that train heist being *chefs kiss* along with bringing back the homie Cad Bane what a legend. The syndicate was a bland generic bad guy group and Boba kinda just lucked into a lot of his allies… super nice of the Hutts to just dispose of their badass wookie in front of Boba so he can get a life debt, also the way that wookie attacked was terrible dude had Boba dead to eights in the tank and then whipped out BRASS KNUCKLES?? The mods were just a sitting group of youth street bikers for him to be like “Eyyy y’all want some work” and then Mando happened to be available and able to get the people of Freetown. It all just felt very unearned. The Rankor was awesome tho great addition, tho I cannot believe how long that last fight went between the good guys vs those droids and HELLA syndicate enemies. That one mod did a spin move and still had time to shoot I was laughing my ass off at how ridiculous it was, nobody died except the Gamorian Guards RIP the loyal homies.

I've never said anyone is an ist or a phobe, but if all you have as a talking point is complaints about the diversity then that's really sad. I'm a Tolkien purist at heart, but I have no problem with skin tones because they not only are absolutely harmless but they aren't even canon. Elves are simply ""fair"" skinned and really only described as such when comparing some elves with other elves. Dwarves don't have skin color described very much if at all. There are seven dwarf clans and we really only deal as readers with 3 (two in 1st age, one in 2nd/3rd age) so who is to say what dwarf skin color should be and that it must be universal? Dwarves are literally made from earth and stone, so why can't their skin color be as diverse as the colors of all the different rocks, gems, minerals, and soils of the world? What about the ""Ironfist"" clan... it could describe their temperament, but it could just as easily describe their literal composition and skin color. Bearded dwarf women is a film only comment. There are as many realreasons why there absolutely could be diversity in casting as anyone can come up with fake reasons why there shouldn't be (nevermind the real world we live in where many parts of the film industry around the world now have actual diversity requirements  in production).","youre jumping from the story never told to better than tolkien which i also think is absurd if you asked anyone involved in any tolkien production ever of any kind i dont think youd get anyone who thinks theyre doing something better than tolkien

But they didn't though, the [Svartálfar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svart%C3%A1lfar) of Norse mythology were synonymous/used interchangeably with [dark elves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%B6kk%C3%A1lfar_and_Lj%C3%B3s%C3%A1lfar) who had, predictably, dark skin and lived underground. 

This kind of argument gets called racist because it's not an argument, it's an _excuse_ based on an assumption - the logic isn't ""we have to maintain the Nordic and Celtic roots of Tolkien's lore to the point where no dwarves should have dark skin because that's what those did"", the logic instead is ""I don't like dark skinned dwarves and elves, and I doubt there were black people in Scandinavia, so their myths Tolkien used as a base probably didn't have them, and that supports the conclusion I'm going for so I'll run with it"".

> Same for pale skin due to being underground for long.

This one too is made up pseudo-scientific nonsense based on a flawed understanding of evolution. If a black person lives in a cave for a few years, do you think they turn white? Do you think dark black skin is like... a really heavy tan? If dwarves were all white because they live underground, shouldn't the same ""logic"" conclude that all men must be black because they don't live underground? Are the Numenorians basically Jamaicans? Also, as mentioned before, it's a fantasy world - why do elves have pointy ears? Why are trolls gray? Why do dwarf women have beards? You don't need a weird pseudo-science justification for any of these.

This is an argument that, again, is just kind of tossed out because it vaguely supports the desired conclusion - ""they shouldn't be black"" - but without any considerations for whether or not it's accurate or consistent. Starting with that conclusion and working backwards is what makes these sound racist.","but as being based on legendary dwarves that dwelled underground and had pale white skin

To clarify, You mean she's 27 At SA 1, and gains 23 years in the second age to be 51 at TA 1? and what's the difference between the 51 quoted and the ""mortal equivalent 38"" part? If 38 signifies her age in mortal years, what's 51 mean? Then at 72/54 in Fo.A 1 she has ended her youth phase? 

 I find that hard to believe that one of the oldest elves in Middle Earth would be ending 'the youth' of her life (if immortal beings can even be said to have a youth in that sense) at 8.5 millennia old... Older than all elves in ME except Cirdan, a truly ancient Elf (yet still, only ~3 millennia older than Galadriel)

Your second point, 

>The show is merging all the five plots into one timeline. We'll see Forging of the Rings and The Downfall without any major time jumps. 

Is kinda exactly what I'm worried about. Pretending P&V Galadriel, which has been defended as 'equivalent of mid-20s fiery Galadriel', and end of second age Galadriel are effectively the same character - in age, and I worry also, in bearing. And any growth (or lack thereof) she goes through in that time will happen within perhaps a few centuries? That doesn't jive with the point of Elves, that they are so wise because they have seen countless generations of Men pass before their eyes.

---

I also think of like equivalent elves -

Thingol was born soon after the elves awakened in YT 1050 and died FA 500 making him 4,300 - 4,800 years old. Galadriel end of SA is OLDER than the great king Thingol was when he met his demise.

Elrond at the end of the Third age is what, ~6,400? Probably closer to the type of bearing you'd expect a 5,400 year old Galadriel to have for the Akallabeth? 

And speaking of Elrond, I am wondering what this wonky time compression will do to him. His twin brother Elros became the first King of Numenor in SA 43. So Elrond will have been alive for *every reign of every Numenorean Ruler*. Shit, the founding King was his own *twin* brother! I worry that, in the show, Elrond will come off as young and naive in the way mortal ~20-year-olds can. Despite him having seen 3 millennia, and being as old as Numenor itself, as old as the reigns of 22 long-lived Numenorean Kings and Queens.","so i havent read nature of me but are you saying the rate at which elves age is different than just a linear  elven years   mortal equivalent year ratio which you quoted first thats an assumption i was making based on your own saying so

The fact you are saying Hobbit ‘series’ is a good indicator, many people didn’t see the need to make it a series. Most of the filler/extended content they added to flesh it out is the stuff people didn’t like so much.

Preferring the Hobbit as a story is fine and many would likely agree with you. Preferring the Hobbit adaptation to the LOTR adaptation is a different topic and I think even Peter Jackson vastly prefers the LOTR.

I also think there’s nothing wrong with liking the Hobbit movies, I think most people on here probably do “like” them. Very few of those people would argue for them being better movies objectively.

Lothlórien), and never forgave them for their part in the destruction of
Doriath; but ....the Dwarves of Moria may be presumed to have been
innocent of the ruin of Doriath and not hostile to the Elves. In any case,
Galadriel was more far-sighted in this than Celeborn; and she perceived
from the beginning that Middle-earth could not be saved from ‘the residue
of evil’ that Morgoth had left behind him save by a union of all the
peoples who were in their way and in their measure opposed to him. She
looked upon the Dwarves also with the eye of a commander, seeing in
them the finest warriors to pit against the Orcs. Moreover Galadriel was a
Noldo, and she had a natural sympathy with their minds and their
passionate love of crafts of hand, sympathy much greater than that found among many of the Eldar: the Dwarves were ‘the Children of Aulë’, and
Galadriel, like others of the Noldor, had been a pupil of Aulë and Yavanna
in Valinor.""

""the power of Galadriel and Celeborn had grown,

Elves of Eregion as had escaped, but he had no force to withstand the
onset. He would indeed have been overwhelmed had not Sauron’s host
been attacked in the rear; for Durin sent out a force of Dwarves from
Khazad-dûm, and with them came Elves of Lórinand led by Amroth.
Elrond was able to extricate himself, but he was forced away northwards,
and it was at that time [in the year 1697, according to the Tale of Years]
that he established a refuge and stronghold at Imladris (Rivendell). Sauron
withdrew the pursuit of Elrond and turned upon the Dwarves and the Elves
of Lórinand, whom he drove back; but the Gates of Moria were shut, and
he could not enter. Ever afterwards Moria had Sauron’s hate, and all Orcs
were commanded to harry Dwarves whenever they might.""

He hardly steps in to help them except the minimum required to seem to fulfill his contract. He misinforms the Syndicate about Freetown, and it's only through his actions that they help out in the end. When Mando and Boba face off against the forces building outside of sanctuary, he could have remained there and been a force multiplier that could have finished them off before their reinforcements arrive, but he waited until the Syndicate's forces and androids had been finished off instead, when there's the greatest risk to him, to face Boba Fett.

I think that Cad Bane's real objective is Boba Fett, and understanding why he has become who he has become. I'm going out on a limb on this theory, but I think there's a chance Cad Bane realizes he's getting old, and he's probably amassed an untold fortune from his bounties, but he just doesn't know how to do anything else with it except bounty hunting. The Syndicate job could have gone two ways, depending on what he discovered about what he didn't know: why Boba Fett changed. He could have provided his full aid to the Syndicate and Boba Fett would have had no chance. Or, he could decide to finally retire. To finally say his goodbyes and his final lessons in his own way, faking his death along the way to avoid all the notoriety that would have prevented his retirement. Cad Bane was edging Boba Fett to attack him in part because he wanted to be defeated, to fake his own death out of the business.

It's probably simpler than all that, and he just comes back for a rematch next season, who knows.","anyone else get the feeling that cad bane was pulling one on the syndicate or at least working for him halfheartedly

20254,131,4,"validate",0,"/r/StarWars","As another fan of the sequels, I enjoy them for what they were as individual movies but their biggest flaw to me is the fact that they don't connect up as well as they could have. The best foreshadowing of Palpatine's return to me is episode 3 when he tells the story of Darth Plagueis which shows:

\- A means of cheating death exists amongst the sith and Palpatine had a connection to its creator.

\- Palpatine is very familiar with the concept of sith betraying their masters.

This is a pretty decent case for Palpatine surviving the OT and coming back in the future. I also felt like, for his status in lore as supposedly one of the most powerful sith lords in existence (Think Lucas said most powerful but not 100% sure of that, or if that still holds canon in current lore), he doesn't display a lot of actual force power relative to some sith that exist in extended lore, plus he dies to...his apprentice betraying him. After he betrayed and killed his master, Palpatine, the scheming mastermind who manipulated everyone to orchestrate the rise of the Empire, was betrayed and killed by his apprentice.

In his appearance in the sequels he actually shows power to bring down an entire fleet with force lightning, defies his first death, and more importantly, actually had a contingency plan for the single most common cause of death amongst sith lords, being betrayed by his apprentice. I do really wish they had built that up a bit more over 7 and 8 though, and especially actually showed his return broadcast.

The one thing I do think was actually planned somewhat, by JJ but not Ryan specifically, was Rey's heritage. There was evidence connecting her to Palpatine like her music and fighting style, and it was a theory I had actually felt had decent backing after Force Awakens. I do think it's likely that JJ threw these in intentionally with plans for it to be built up more over the next two movies before Ryan went a different direction, then JJ got the last movie and went back to his original plan.","as another fan of the sequels i enjoy them for what they were as individual movies but their biggest flaw to me is the fact that they dont connect up as well as they could have the best foreshadowing of palpatines return to me is episode  when he tells the story of darth plagueis which shows

As a matter of fact, the mystery around her family is the largest source of character building given to her character in TFA, with her having few other notable characteristics or motivations to explore.

This naturally sets up the premise that her family is highly important and that is what is driving her abilities. Then TLJ says ""actually your parents were nobodies who sold you for liquor money, and you're just naturally more gifted than any other force user before.""

 There’s also the matter of the etymology of the word elf, something that I can guarantee you he was very aware of. 

“ Germanic *ɑlβi-z~*ɑlβɑ-z is generally agreed to be a cognate with Latin albus ('(matt) white'); Old Irish ailbhín ('flock'); Greek alphoús ('white'; ἀλφούς); Albanian elb ('barley'); and Germanic words for 'swan' such as Modern Icelandic álpt. These all come from an Indo-European root *h₂elbʰ-, and seem to be connected by the idea of whiteness. The Germanic word presumably originally meant ""white one,"" perhaps as a euphemism. Jakob Grimm thought whiteness implied positive moral connotations, and, noting Snorri Sturluson's ljósálfar, suggested that elves were divinities of light. This is not necessarily the case, however. For example, because the cognates suggest matt white rather than shining white, and because in medieval Scandinavian texts whiteness is associated with beauty, Alaric Hall has suggested that elves may have been called ""the white people"" because whiteness was associated with (specifically feminine) beauty.[38] Some scholars have argued that the names Albion and Alps may also be related.[35]”

29439,163,4,"validate",1,"/r/lotr","> Whitewashing is different than diversifying. One is erasing minorities while one is making something better representative of reality.

Yes and no. Apples to oranges. Diversity isn't inherently good in and of itself. Purposely editing characters, races, and ethnicities is bad, no matter which way it goes. A movie set in the middle of Africa, Asia, or pre-colonial America should not be diverse. Modern Europe and the US should absolutely be diverse. Living in a diverse culture, overall media diversity is a good thing, but applying it to certain specific/historical settings is not.

You're insisting on a worse representation of reality. This is a historical setting. That's one of the reasons *Gods of Egypt* was a terribly done movie, it was a horrible representation of historical reality even though it represented modern America.

> The doesn't matter is in reference to people in the majority not caring about minority representation because it is always easy to find people like you represented.

You're straw-manning here. People are arguing for accurate world-building. I've seen plenty of black and white people arguing for the same thing. The vast majority of the people on both sides of this argument are white, simply because 80% of the US and 86% of England are. The problem isn't at all the color of the people arguing each side.

> In the case of RoP, no characters of known ethnicity were swapped.

Known races were ethnically edited. It'd be like making random Wakanda natives Asian or native American in the Black Panther movie.

> Tolkien was adamant that his world did not represent Europe.

Tolkien was adamant about many things. He hated allegory, and Middle Earth didn't contain it. Middle Earth is literally our world, pre-history, not just Europe. It was also created, at least in part, as a mythology dedicated to England. 

There is a place in Middle Earth that became Europe.

He created well defined histories, ethnicities, and cultures for Númenor, Gondor, and Rohan. Well defined and described races of elves, dwarves, and Men (including hobbits). Even different ethnic descriptions for different groups of elves and hobbits.

> 2021 was the highest ever at 20% of major roles being minorities

That's great. About 20% of the US population are minorities, so this could actually be considered a perfect balance. Individual settings should have specific standards though.","whitewashing is different than diversifying one is erasing minorities while one is making something better representative of reality

She basicly now tweets about characters sexualities and claims to have written in some hidden overarching social commentary, which in some cases actually may be the case but in others one can clearly tell she just wants to keep herself relevant and pander to the weirdo crowd who actually care about Dumbledore being gay and all that shit. It's weird, since she clearly had some great things in mind but her success seems to relly have gotten to her head and now she desperately tries to keep herself relevant, instead of just accepting that Harry Potter is a beloved series she could expand on with new books or other stories instead of making micro-changes that just piss fans off due to being unnecessary. Also, she goes hard against ""the patriarchy"" which may have been a good cause in the 1700s and in some countries even as far as the 1980s and 90s but in todays world it is a bit weird to talk about ""the patriarchy"" and fighting against it, especially if you are one of the worlds most famous female authors, whose books have inspired millions if not billions of people. 


With GoT I meant the general treatment of fans and their treatment of stories and arcs they had set up and of course the weird ""girl power"" moments they included that sometimes were out of character and other times just stole epic moments from other characters.


To address two franchises I forgot:
With Marvel and DC I really dont care much, since I really like some changes they made but the newer ones get worse and worse, especially those ""girl power"" moments... as if we didn't think black widow was a badass before she posed with all the other women and said ""men bad women good"". Or as if we didn't think Scarlet Witch has epic abilities before showing up and doing the stuff ""men cant do"". For DC, the changes they make get drowned out by the awful storytelling that some movies just suffer majorly from and in most cases I cant be upset when someone simply cant act... at that point the changes are irrelevant, since there are different problems at hand. Also those have at least a good explanation why they are diverse, dince they take place in modern day america - although that one black soldier fighting for hydra seemed a bit weird, especially if it is supposed to be 1945s germany...



It is a general trend we see in modern media, which is sad, since the old way of including commentary gets throen out of the window and good stories get sidelined to shove some message into the audiences faces. My main problem with that is, that it doesn't really do anything. I mean, if you are a sexist, racist and an overall asshole for like 40 years of your life, then you wont change your entire personality and way of life because you saw some action chick do cool stuff or see a black guy being a badass. Also, if you hate gay folks, then you will still hate fay folks after seeing them in a movie.

Most of the action sequences for EPs 1-4/7 were a mixed bag. Like, MCU levels of zero feeling of stakes. Having a whole ass fucking conversation while dealing with those bots and standing out in the open really made the threat feel nerfed.

It's almost the embodiment of ""Tolkien for the masses"".

However, we don't have any indication that Amazon's series is doing this. In fact, what we know seems to indicate that they're not shying away from the biblical/mythological fantasy that Tolkien paints these eras with. Thats why I bring up the War of Wrath and Valinor.

It's not that I think it is WRONG for there to be contradictions. It's that I think it is a problem that needs to be solved with care. The Lord of the Rings showed the utmost care in how they changed things. You can see that in not just the end product but also the behind the scenes footage. 

Contrast that trilogy with the interviews we have gotten for the RoP series.

Not much good to say, but I did love that we got to see the kneepad rocket-dart launchers in action. I think everything with the Rancor looked amazing. The Mando/Boba team-up was decent and disregarding some strange editing choices I enjoyed the way Boba ultimately defeated Cad Bane.

Ignoring the context, I did appreciate seeing the rickshaw droid again, that was one of my favourite prequel designs. I was surprised that they were able to make the ending fairly cohesive considering the lengthy detour that we just experienced.

I know I never got to the extended write-up I promised last week - I was just too depressed about the state of the show. I'd like to do an in-depth season analysis, but I think I'm still too sad about how this all went off the rails. It just seems like a tragic waste of resources and potential - it showed flashes of brilliance but ultimately failed more than it succeeded. At the very least I can give it more credit than the sequels - when it went down in flames it wasn't due to indifference or malice, I think the creatives had a lot of heart, they just generally didn't know what they were doing a lot of the times and don't have a lot of storytelling talent. (I'm not quite sure about Filoni though - sometimes it seems like his goal is to just put in as many of his characters as he can.) Anyway, I'm sad that they didn't bother to tell an arc or do any character development with Boba Fett.We still have no clue as to his motivations. In some ways the canonical version is a lot worse than what we had before. It's also a shame they spent so much times on detours and pointless side characters that the conclusion felt so pathetic. It genuinely feels like they got bored of the character halfway through and just decided to return to the story they like better (and even when they did so, a lot of it was just retreading things we've already seen).

Because they never do the diversity thing in a way that is reasonable or preserves the suspense of disbelief, and for a fantasy show to be taken seriously it *must* preserve it, otherwise the audience will just go, ""well this is all silly nonsense"" and will tune out. For the audience to accept the fantastical elements, the mundane ones must be done realistically. After all, we know how this works in the real world. People living in the same location for many generations will eventually all kinda look alike, in terms of phenotype, unless there's some form of forced segregation according to those same phenotypes.

A good example of it done poorly is in WoT, where in a tiny, remote mountain village, you've got a whole of a dozen families, supposedly with deep seated roots in this village, having lived there for generations upon generations, each a different color. 

Now, either the show aims to tell us all their family trees are wreathes, or they didn't care about the internal consistency of the setting they're using. I would find it just as silly as having a bunch of white Wakandans just hanging out in Black Panther without anyone commenting on it. It takes you out of the story. 

Now, how it could be done well in this show, for example with the black Dwarf woman, is if her Dwarven society are black.

**The characters are still who they are**; the skin tone of the actor is different. *That's it!* It should no more destroy your immersion than watching a period drama in ye olden American Colonial times where the accents are slightly off or all the *white* actors are not of a particular height, milk-white skin tone, or of typically Anglo features. You have not once in your life seen an actor of Greek descent play a Redcoat and thought, ""Ugh, I'm really being pulled out of the film, this guy doesn't look English enough."" You've seen a slew of Italians and Germans play every European and American ethnicity under the sun without complaint, even when they're more or less ""*swarthy*"", to use Ben Franklin's favorite word on tone, than they historically would be. 

Yet you would relegate anyone of a significantly dark skin tone to ""their"" stories. They are to be banned from ""our"" *white* media, the vast and overwhelming majority of what's out there, unless we can pigeonhole them into this tiny handful of roles. And that's good, you say, because it's only *fair* if whites are kept from not portraying Martin Luther King Jr. 

This ""I want to see more of *their* stories"" shit doesn't fly, either. It's a bunch of sounds-good bullshit that people just drag out with exactly zero expectation of ever seeing done, an imaginary bone thrown to the dogs to get them to run out of the room after a shadow and leave you in peace to enjoy your lily-white media. You think every black actor, then, now, and in the future, is just itching to tell the stories of Africa? That that's where their cultural connection is? That's how they think of themselves or their roots? That this feeling of some white dude in suburban Missouri who can actually trace his genealogy back to a specific family at a specific time in Ireland and makes it a chunk of his personality and plays it up every St. Patrick's Day is shared by the average black person of *some fuckin' group* in Africa? No. We've done the pan-African nationalism deal and come out on the other side of it with no one fucking caring now.

You can't just shunt ethnic actors into *new* fantasy roles (because the old ones are all white), historical dramas where they're all shit on or enslaved, modern- and future-era stories, and the handful of mythologies that are ""theirs"" (as opposed to the much broader and fleshed-out catalogue that is ""acceptable for whites"").

Doing things like that in our media *does not preclude* having more ethnically-indulgent stories or roles; we can say a Japanese woman can play King Lear without getting into a frothing rage just barely concealed by bad faith arguments *and* actually act on those arguments by making the next fantasy epic about Amaterasu, get it?","you absolute chowderhead this is not change for the sake of diversity the story isnt changing get it through your skull

And there's little doubt those people would have poured everything they had into making their contribution be as amazing as possible. Whatever it became in the end, or whatever the sets looked like (also keeping in mind that earth-like environments are slightly easier to shoot practical than space and futuristic things), is a different argument. They were also a very different, more experienced (in the fiml industry) crew and production, with more streamlined and set work flows etc, which can also sometimes affect how things look on set. I'm not here to argue for the use of effects or cgi in the SW prequels, or for the movies in general, but it's just a good thing to remember that over simplifications like ""sets felt sterile to some other film's cast, so no passion"" are not actually all that helpful.

Then, I would argue you are likely jumping into conclusions based on an emotional bias also with this production. There is no way of knowing what the level of passion of the crew and cast is for now. Do you actually know who is working on this? That is a genuine question, because it would be required for you to know anything about their passion.

All that said, yes, this is a production which started from corporate ambition rather than as a passion project of a group of filmmakers. And there is some evidence of modernisation instead of sticking with the original. The tone, grading, lighting, etc seem a bit generic fantasy initially (some of that can change still, however). Personally, I feel like I might end up not liking the series much, but I will still wait and see and look forward to seeing and hearing some bits of middle earth visuals and such. And, of course, I'd love to be wrong and for the show to be great. We shall see.","first of all for all its flaws star wars was absolutely a passion project its sort of nuts to claim otherwise it was likely a childhood dream of most of the designers and crew to be working on a star wars movie since they would have grown up with the originals and theres little doubt those people would have poured everything they had into making their contribution be as amazing as possible whatever it became in the end or whatever the sets looked like also keeping in mind that earthlike environments are slightly easier to shoot practical than space and futuristic things is a different argument they were also a very different more experienced in the fiml industry crew and production with more streamlined and set work flows etc which can also sometimes affect how things look on set im not here to argue for the use of effects or cgi in the sw prequels or for the movies in general but its just a good thing to remember that over simplifications like sets felt sterile to some other films cast so no passion are not actually all that helpful

As for your third point, I think an anime would do this world justice (especially one done by Warner Brothers) simply because they have proven time and time again that they know how to do this, and how to do this right; besides, anyone who's read a manga and then watch an anime based on it knows that the Japanese have a major respect for the source materials that they base their work off of, much unlike what the producers and writers for RoP have admitted to wanting to do with the show - that much is even evident by all the new stuff they're shoving into it unnaturally and a lot of the time compression of the world of Middle Earth (which for lore reasons doesn't work and has big, far reaching consequences).

Whatever combination of responsibilities over the direction of this show, it was pretty appalling considering it’s importance in the Star Wars TV presence. Awkward choreography and performances, lame and slow action sequences. Baffling character choices and logic and missed opportunities all the way through. 

Rodriguez’s fingerprints are all over some of the worst elements of the show but I feel it would be naive to blame him entirely and I can’t help but wonder what Favreau was doing.

Everything about the Mods are terrible. I’ve always known Star Wars to have a very strong fashion bible and every one of those characters and their bikes stuck out like a sore thumb. Sophie Thatcher is literally just dressed as a punk. At least the main male Mod’s outfit felt slightly more like something I’d imagine on Coruscant or Solo’s party yacht. Her performance especially was so distracting, it felt like I was watching a drama school audition. I don’t know Thundercat but every time he appeared it felt like a goofy cameo, especially with the sudden techno in the Dark Angel-like Mod workshop scene.

One thing that been consistent throughout the Mandalorian and now tBoBF, and I don’t see talked about much, is the way both leads’ actions make them seem unbelievably stupid. They walk out into gunfire (without their armour offering enough protection for the situation in which they usually end up knocked on their knees), fall into traps, and usually take a short sighted and flawed path to whatever their objective is. I can’t tell if they’re meant to be written as naive and impulsive but seeing the behaviour now echoed in Boba Fett, I have to assume it comes from the people writing the scripts.

What I hate about the dialogue around this show is how some fans saw women in armor and black characters and claimed the show will be garbage, then tried to justify this incongruent assumption by saying “oh it’s bad because it’s not faithful to a nearly 90 year old novel”. Of course it’s not. The world has changed a lot since then. Media has changed a lot since then. An adaptation doesn’t have to be faithful to be good. If the show is bad, it will be because the writing, acting, and production is poor or because it’s a cashgrab, not because the team took liberties with race.

looked upon the Dwarves also with the eye of a commander, seeing in
them the finest warriors to pit against the Orcs. Moreover Galadriel was a
Noldo, and she had a natural sympathy with their minds and their
passionate love of crafts of hand, sympathy much greater than that found among many of the Eldar: the Dwarves were ‘the Children of Aulë’, and

At the end of the day, what the title of this series promised something fans have craved for more than 40 years... an exploration of Boba Fett.  The series fails miserably on that front.  The only real Boba moment is riding the Rancor and even that fell flat.  The fact that it's the fan service that we're talking about as the high points of the series, isn't a good look.  Filoni's fan service only works when it's a small part of a great story.  It doesn't work when it's doing the heavy lifting to make a series enjoyable.","to make star wars feel like its all connected all while almost always doing it in a way that makes total sense isnt forced and doesnt make the universe feel too small

43280,476,4,"validate",1,"/r/lotr","This is basically straight up propaganda, from start to finish. It is deeply... something to the point that it is difficult to not straight up cast aspersions against the author.

First, I reject the premise that historical context in this matter would be helpful. Historical context is essentially trying to extrapolate from the past. There are serious issues with trying to do this for a great many things and it can easily lead you astray. For example, if little Timmy has a cat and two siblings, Alice and Bob, Alice could, for some strange reason, develop a habit of saying ""Timmy, your cat will die this year"", and say that every year. If, after many years of this happening, Bob were to then say ""Timmy, your cat will die this year"", that does not make Bob's claim automatically wrong, or fallacious, despite the ""historic context"". Bob could, for example, be noticing that Timmy's cat has cancer, is very old for a cat, and the vet told Bob the cat is likely going to die this year. Nothing about Alice's prior comments really have any bearing on Bob's.

This means, before we even get into specifics, this is already an exercise that is without merit.

Second, I reject that the thread linked shows what you think it shows. From the title alone we can tell there is a mismatch here. You characterize this as ""forum discussion"", but the actual title of the thread is *""What change in the movies ticks you off the most?""*. While technically your characterization is true you then go on to say ""Just to clarify, obviously I've picked some of the most ridiculous ones in that thread, but the vast majority of the comments in that thread were very negative."" This would be extremely obvious to infer from the title of the thread, since this is *only* about the negative aspects of the changes that people thought were in the movie at the time. The way it is stated sounds nefarious, and as if the films were a hotbed of controversy, rather than this being a specific thread trying to bring out things that people didn't like about the films. It is perfectly possible for someone to be contributing to this thread about something that they didn't like, while also having a positive outlook of the movies as a whole. While you don't come out and outright state that this means fellowship was viewed negatively, tons of people in the comments here seem to be inferring that, which is not supported by this thread. Indeed, in the thread itself, there are people who say they are looking forward to the movie.

>The main purpose of this post is to remind people that the show is still months away and we still know very little about it and that a bit more patience, optimism, and open-mindedness would be healthy for ourselves, the fandom, and the show and its cast and staff. 

Actually, as came up in discussion of this very thread, it is healthiest for the fandom to be vocal about things it doesn't like. Arwen's expanded role in LotR was dialed back as a direct result of fan backlash. Not only that, but what we've seen from the show at this point being disappointing is a critical issue. It would be better for the show if they decided to say, change marketing teams, or show better footage, if the show is actually good. Ignoring bad marketing of a good show can only hurt the show in the long run. The important thing here is to be *honest* and *upfront*, rather than to pursue optimism in the face of what we've seen, which I, for one, think looks absolutely dreadful.

>Some of the concerns/critiques actually had a point and made sense given what they knew back then. 

The concerns/critiques were almost all on the nose, I just don't assign them as much weight as these people did. The problem here is that you are approaching this issue that the movies being good is objectively correct, rather than a subjective but generalized opinion. The movies are not 100% true to the books, and there are people *to this very day* who do not like them as a result. That is not them having deluded themselves into thinking that the movies are bad or anything, they simply have a different perspective on Tolkien, his works, and their adaptation into the movies than you do. Indeed, if asked the exact same original question these forum users were asked, you would find many of these exact same points being brought up *to this very day*. They, shockingly presciently, pinpointed issues and controversies that mostly wouldn't die, and even movie fans routinely express dislike of.

> Almost all of their concerns turned out to be unnecessary, or at least the issues didn't affect the overall quality of the movie or audience's enjoyment. 

You're assuming that they're speaking about a general audience, when, in actuality, some of them make it quite clear they are not. This is just a strawman.

>that's how a movie works: it's not just the simple sum of all the individual scenes or elements, but an organic whole that should be appreciated holistically. Isolated images/footages rarely offer a fair and accurate view of the final product.

You're kinda right, except that what we've seen so far is marketing. Marketing is supposed to offer the best possible image of the final product. Not only this but again, they did levy valid criticism, and the final LOTR films does highly reflect the original trailers and marketing material. If you didn't like the look of the original promos, you probably didn't like the final character designs and costumes, because they were the same. So, if we were to extrapolate that to RoP, then that would mean the people who don't like the costuming, character designs and casting, are probably going to share that same opinion of the final product. Of course, as I said earlier, extrapolation like this can lead us astray.

>By obsessing over random details of the movie outside of proper context, those fans essentially ruined the movies for themselves for no good reason.

This is entirely your interpretation of things, but it is stated like a fact. The overlap between ""diehard, serious about dedication of the movies to lore, pre-movie LotR fan"" and ""would nit-pick the movie no matter what"" is probably essentially a circle. We could easily draw the exact opposite conclusion, that they obsessed over random details of the movie they had seen (which is not outside ""proper context""), because they were going to nit-pick the film. They just started early.

>Yes, the corporations behind the productions will almost always prioritize profit -- it's just how the industry and our economy works -- but it doesn't mean the product can't be good at the same time. At least we shouldn't let the fandom and the show become collateral damage of our frustration at the status quo of the industry, commercialism, and the economic system in general

The problem is that from what we've seen the studio has walked all over the showrunners, or the showrunners just really don't care that much. The casting choices, hair styles and more ""modern"" look, all *scream* studio interference. Which makes a lot of sense when you have no-name showrunners with a no-name cast given a massive budget and a lot of pressure. We will let this franchise become ""collateral damage"" when we just give a fake smile and say ""this is all okay"", while we have every sign that Amazon is going to blend this show into a fine, corporate whitewashed puddle of fantasy muck, and then try to mass-market it.

>No matter how you feel about the Ring of Power show right now, just take it easy and try to relax. None of us knows if it'll be good or not, and that's ok.

The part about this comment that comes the most across as propaganda, is that it tries to push a particular message quite heavily, and then veers just a little bit away from outright stating it. The obvious takeaway here is ""people who are concerned or complaining about RoP are wrong because people in the past were wrong"", which is what a lot of people in this thread and others are taking away from it, because it is deceptively and poorly written.

You'll notice I avoided the comments up until now, that's because they really don't matter due to the above issues, but I might as well go through them, since people tend to see a wall of links and think that makes someone correct. I'll probably go through them in another comment.","this is basically straight up propaganda from start to finish it is deeply something to the point that it is difficult to not straight up cast aspersions against the author

first i reject the premise that historical context in this matter would be helpful historical context is essentially trying to extrapolate from the past there are serious issues with trying to do this for a great many things and it can easily lead you astray for exle if little timmy has a cat and two siblings alice and bob alice could for some strange reason develop a habit of saying timmy your cat will die this year and say that every year if after many years of this happening bob were to then say timmy your cat will die this year that does not make bobs claim automatically wrong or fallacious despite the historic context bob could for exle be noticing that timmys cat has cancer is very old for a cat and the vet told bob the cat is likely going to die this year nothing about alices prior comments really have any bearing on bobs

this means before we even get into specifics this is already an exercise that is without merit

second i reject that the thread linked shows what you think it shows from the title alone we can tell there is a mismatch here you characterize this as forum discussion but the actual title of the thread is what change in the movies ticks you off the most while technically your characterization is true you then go on to say just to clarify obviously ive picked some of the most ridiculous ones in that thread but the vast majority of the comments in that thread were very negative this would be extremely obvious to infer from the title of the thread since this is only about the negative aspects of the changes that people thought were in the movie at the time the way it is stated sounds nefarious and as if the films were a hotbed of controversy rather than this being a specific thread trying to bring out things that people didnt like about the films it is perfectly possible for someone to be contributing to this thread about something that they didnt like while also having a positive outlook of the movies as a whole while you dont come out and outright state that this means fellowship was viewed negatively tons of people in the comments here seem to be inferring that which is not supported by this thread indeed in the thread itself there are people who say they are looking forward to the movie

the main purpose of this post is to remind people that the show is still months away and we still know very little about it and that a bit more patience optimism and openmindedness would be healthy for ourselves the fandom and the show and its cast and staff 

actually as came up in discussion of this very thread it is healthiest for the fandom to be vocal about things it doesnt like arwens expanded role in lotr was dialed back as a direct result of fan backlash not only that but what weve seen from the show at this point being disappointing is a critical issue it would be better for the show if they decided to say change marketing teams or show better footage if the show is actually good ignoring bad marketing of a good show can only hurt the show in the long run the important thing here is to be honest and upfront rather than to pursue optimism in the face of what weve seen which i for one think looks absolutely dreadful

some of the concernscritiques actually had a point and made sense given what they knew back then 

the concernscritiques were almost all on the nose i just dont assign them as much weight as these people did the problem here is that you are approaching this issue that the movies being good is objectively correct rather than a subjective but generalized opinion the movies are not  true to the books and there are people to this very day who do not like them as a result that is not them having deluded themselves into thinking that the movies are bad or anything they simply have a different perspective on tolkien his works and their adaptation into the movies than you do indeed if asked the exact same original question these forum users were asked you would find many of these exact same points being brought up to this very day they shockingly presciently pinpointed issues and controversies that mostly wouldnt die and even movie fans routinely express dislike of

 almost all of their concerns turned out to be unnecessary or at least the issues didnt affect the overall quality of the movie or audiences enjoyment 

youre assuming that theyre speaking about a general audience when in actuality some of them make it quite clear they are not this is just a strawman

thats how a movie works its not just the simple sum of all the individual scenes or elements but an organic whole that should be appreciated holistically isolated imagesfootages rarely offer a fair and accurate view of the final product

youre kinda right except that what weve seen so far is marketing marketing is supposed to offer the best possible image of the final product not only this but again they did levy valid criticism and the final lotr films does highly reflect the original trailers and marketing material if you didnt like the look of the original promos you probably didnt like the final character designs and costumes because they were the same so if we were to extrapolate that to rop then that would mean the people who dont like the costuming character designs and casting are probably going to share that same opinion of the final product of course as i said earlier extrapolation like this can lead us astray

by obsessing over random details of the movie outside of proper context those fans essentially ruined the movies for themselves for no good reason

But once the Fellowship is broken, Tolkien also breaks up the timelines.

And all the time there are events that we only get to hear about after the fact,  with friends and folk reporting to the Hobbits of past events. We don’t follow Aragorn as he conquers the corsairs, we only hear of it as he tells his story to the Hobbits, after the battle is already won.

So you agree that Tolkien described as a very powerful Amazon who could do Amazonian war feats. 

""Nor were the 'loremasters' a separate guild of gentle scribes, soon burned by the Orks of Angband upon pyres of books. They were mostly even as Feanor, the greatest, kings, princes and warriors, such as the valiant captains of Gondolin, or Finrod of Nargothrond and Rodothir \[> Arothir\] his kinsman and steward."" - Shibboleth of Feanor  

In the Shibboleth Galadriel is described as a loremaster as well.  In the Book of Lost Tales part 2 Idril fights in the Fall of Gondolin (by using a sword). In Shaping of Middle-earth Christopher says Idril was ""the prototype of Galadriel"".  

Galadriel fighting at Alqualondë: ""Galadriel’s quarrel with the sons of Fëanor at sack of Alqualondë. How she fought…"" - Nature of Middle-earth  

Note that the event of fighting at Alqualonde itself is described as a quarrel by Tolkien: ""...Thrice the folk of Feanor were driven back, and many were slain upon either side; but the vanguard of the Noldor were succoured by Fingon with the foremost people of Fingolfin. These coming up found a battle joined and their own kin falling, and they rushed in ere they knew rightly the cause of the quarrel: some deemed indeed that the Teleri had sought to waylay the march of the Noldor, at the bidding of the Valar."" 

 There's a marginal note against this passage in Morgoth's Ring: ""$149 Marginal note against the passage describing the involvement of the second host in the fighting: 'Finrod and Galadriel (whose husband was of the Teleri) fought against Feanor in defence of Alqualonde.' ""  

And in Shibboleth: ""she fought fiercely against Feanor in defence of her mother's kin."" Note that she wasn't the only female fighter at Alqualondë. Since we are told: ""indeed in dire straits or desperate defence the Nissi \[the Elf-women\] fought valiantly"" - Laws and Customs  

But the difference between Galadriel and other Nissi was that she wasn't only brave, but she was also a leader and Amazon.

""Galadriel, the fairest lady of the house of Finwë and the most valiant."" - Morgoth's Ring

""She was called Nerwen ‘man-maiden’ because of her strength and stature, and her courage."" - Nature of Middle-earth

""Galadriel the Valiant and Fair"" -  Morgoth's Ring. 

 ""\[Galadriel\] was then of Amazon disposition and bound up her hair as a crown when taking part in athletic feats” - Tolkien Letter 348  

“\[Éowyn\] was also not really a soldier or ‘amazon’, but like many brave women was capable of great military gallantry at a crisis.” - The Letters of JRR Tolkien, Letter #244 

 The only women in Tolkien who are described as 'amazon' are Haleth (the warrior Queen/Chieftain of Haladin), the early versions of Eowyn in History of Lord of the Rings (she openly goes to war in those versions as opposed to the final version where she wasn't Amazon), Makar's sister the Valie/Goddess of War (from the Book of Lost Tales) and Galadriel. Tolkien translated the word Amazon into ""Gothwin"" in Elvish, but the literal translation of Gothwin is ""War Woman"".  

""She looked upon the Dwarves also with the eye of a commander, seeing in them the finest warriors to pit against the Orcs"" - Unfinished Tales  

Galadriel did fight in some wars against Angband like The Battle of the Lammoth and War of Wrath (implied but not explicitly stated). She was there in the Battle of the Lammoth (as a leader of the Second Host) and therefore fought (all elf women fight in such times of crisis), and according to History of Middle-earth Eonwë summoned all free people and birds and beasts to fight in War of Wrath, only cowards rejected his summons (""but the power and dread of Morgoth was great and many did not obey his summons""). Galadriel wasn't such. The reason Galadriel and Celeborn hadn't fought in previous battles against Angband is not because they weren't good warriors, the reason was... ""they did not join in the war against Angband, which they judged to be hopeless under the ban of the Valar and without their aid; and their counsel was... "" - Unfinished Tales  

Nobody listened to their counsel about forming that alliance, and the Valar didn't send aid until War of Wrath, henceforth Celeborn and Galadriel thought it's useless if they waste their energy in that war as long as there's no hope. But when hope came, there was no reason for them to not join in the war. Even random Elves of Eriador answered the summons to fight when they heard of new come hope. 

 In the versions of Galadriel where her boyfriend/husband was from Doriath she also gone through some of the events of the Ruin of Beleriand (here it is never said if she had left Doriath before its fall and indeed it is stated she only crossed the mountains into Eriador in the Second Age and indeed it is even stated in a note about Celeborn that he was present in the sack of Doriath), all meaning/implying she was there in the Ruin of Doriath and the Third Kinslaying and such (as is also pointed out by Christopher Tolkien himself). We know female Elves fought in such times of crisis, even if they weren't Amazon. 

In Second Age Galadriel was one of the war leaders of Eregion in the War of the Elves and Sauron. In the early versions Galadriel is not present in Eregion during the war (she was in Lorien), and it's her husband and Celebrimbor (and later Elrond) only who lead the armies of Eregion: ""The scouts and vanguard of Sauron's host were already approaching when Celeborn made a sortie and drove them back; but though he was able to join his force to that of Elrond...."" - Unfinished Tales

But in later essays and notes Galadriel is there right side-by-side with Celeborn: “Galadriel and Celeborn, and their followers, who after the destruction of Eregion passed through Moria” “Galadriel and Celeborn only retreated thither \[to Lorien\] after the downfall of Eregion."" “After the Fall of Eregion... They had passed through Moria with considerable following of Noldorin Exiles and dwelt for many years in Lorien” In Eregion Galadriel and Celeborn took part ""in its defence against Sauron""

Above quotes are from Parma Eldalamberon 17 and Nature of Middle-earth.

In Unfinished Tales there's yet another wholly different version of Galadriel during the WotE&S where she apparently retreated from Eregion after its fall and ""joined with Gil-Galad in Lindon"". I should note that the Battle of Eregion was long, Sauron assaulted Eriador in 1695 and Eregion fell in 1697. Then three years later or so Sauron assaulted Lindon. So going by this other version of Galadriel where she retreated to Lindon, she most likely also fought in the rest of the War of the Elves and Sauron

Tolkien was still revising her First Age story and had not given much thought to finishing Second Age story in last years of his life. If he had finally finished her First Age story and returned to finishing her Second Age story, we would've known where was she in the latter half of the Second Age. We also would've known where was she during the first 1000 years of the Third Age. There's just many gaps in her story.

This is not correct. Tolkien wrote that this was his initial inspiration, yes, but also that his work moved well past this concept very quickly. Adhering to something Tolkien only started with and moved beyond, in such an absurdly literal way, as justification to castigate an adaptation for including people with relatively darker skin pigmentation, is absolutely deplorable.

ETA, a citation from Tolkien:

> Do not laugh! But once upon a time **(my crest has long since fallen)** I had a mind to make a body of more or less connected legend, ranging from the large and cosmogonic, to the level of romantic fairy-story - the larger founded on the lesser in contact with the earth, the lesser drawing splendour from the vast backcloths - which I could dedicate simply to: to England; to my country.

Emphasis mine. That's how it started. But that's not where the larger work ended up.

Also, Tolkien deplored racism, elevating one skin color above others. I am certain he would be utterly appalled by this controversy of casting a few POC actors for characters that weren't even in his mythos, but are inventions of the adaptors.","this is supposed to be english mythology from  years ago not a contemporary english society

> I am speaking here, of course, of the primary expression of Fantasy in “pictorial” arts, not of “illustrations”; nor of the cinematograph. However good in themselves, illustrations do little good to fairy-stories. The radical distinction between all art (including drama) that offers a visible presentation and true literature is that it imposes one visible form. Literature works from mind to mind and is thus more progenitive. It is at once more universal and more poignantly particular. If it speaks of bread or wine or stone or tree, it appeals to the whole of these things, to their ideas; yet each hearer will give to them a peculiar personal embodiment in his imagination. Should the story say “he ate bread,” the dramatic producer or painter can only show ”a piece of bread” according to his taste or fancy, but the hearer of the story will think of bread in general and picture it in some form of his own. If a story says “he climbed a hill and saw a river in the valley below,” the illustrator may catch, or nearly catch, his own vision of such a scene; but every hearer of the words will have his own picture, and it will be made out of all the hills and rivers and dales he has ever seen, but especially out of The Hill, The River, The Valley which were for him the first embodiment of the word.","the kerfuffle had me go back to on fairystories and this reflection on surrealism vs fantasy

I doubt Tolkien viewed his Middle Earth as being more diverse than England actually was (in terms of skin tone) back in Anglo-Saxon times, which seems to be around the period he's going for.

He apparently started working on Middle Earth as a prehistory myth for England, so populating it with diverse races wasn't really a priority.

It would be like reading the Raybearer books, which are African fantasy stories (specifically influenced by West African culture), and insisting that there should be diverse races because it's awfully convenient that some black people have lighter skin than others, and white people live in African today.

On that note, I still think one of the greatest travesties of this adaptation is that the female Dwarves don't have beards.  Not tiny beards, but the same large beards as men.

34257,127,4,"validate",1,"/r/lotr","I'm not exactly savvy with this kind of thing, but I'll do my best to answer your question.

First, I'll start with your question about why Gimli didn't know about the fate of Balin and his expedition. I don't remember it being mentioned in the movie but in the book, (I think it was during the Council of Elrond), Gimli and his father Gloin inform everyone that not too long ago, Balin and a company of dwarves ventured to Khazad-dum to reclaim it, especially considering that the Quest for Erebor in The Hobbit was a success. However, they did mention that no word has ever been sent to the dwarves back in Erebor regarding the fate of the expedition. In other words, no one knew whether or not Balin and co. were successful in reclaiming Moria, or even if they were even still alive at that point. Gimli also does show enthusiasm to enter Moria in the book and I'm guessing that's because he's being an optimist here.

TL;DR for the Gimli question: Nobody knew what happened to the dwarves who tried to reclaim Moria, Gimli was probably just being an optimist that they were successful.

&#x200B;

Now with regards to Gandalf, again, we'll have to look at the books for this. While I'm pretty sure that everyone knew that Durin's Bane was in Moria for a pretty long time, I don't think anyone knew that Durin's Bane was, in fact, a Balrog of Morgoth. This can be seen in the reactions of Legolas, Gimli, and Gandalf once the enemy revealed itself in the Bridge of Khazad-dum chapter. In fact, Gandalf being hesitant to go into Moria is a movie-only thing as in the book, it was he who suggested to the fellowship to go through Moria after the events at Caradhras and pretty much everyone else (except for Gimli and eventually Frodo) were all against it, especially Aragorn.

TL;DR for the Gandalf question: It's a movie-only thing as in the book, it was Gandalf who insisted to pass through Moria with the majority of the fellowship being against it. Also, while he may be aware of the existence of Durin's Bane, he may not have known that it was a Balrog.

&#x200B;

37450,217,4,"validate",1,"/r/lotr",">I think you are missing the point, that in my period drama there are black people, they are slaves, and come from Africa.

>I am all in favor of one of the leading roles of the TV series being portrayed by a black actor, **but they have to be a fucking slave.**

>That would be **the bog-standard stance we've taken on casting black actors or pretty much anyone of non-white ethnicities for-fucking-ever** when it comes to stories earlier than the mid-1800s.

I implore you to understand. When you make this ""race of the actor"" argument to protect your ~immersion~ in the fiction, a story where you are already imagining fantastic elves and magic and know that the actor here isn't actually as short or tall or the right ethnicity or has a different hair color or their peachy skin tone is technically a bit off, what you're implicitly doing at the same time is saying, ""Non-white actors should be barred from the overwhelming about of roles in historical and fantasy fiction because I don't want to look at them.""

Are you an American of Indian descent? Is there a boom in Hollywood for Civil War era dramas? You're shut out. You're not white enough to be one of the white dudes, and you're not dark enough to play a slave, so fuuuuuck you, we guess. Maybe we could write a role for one of the few people of that ethnicity that did exist in America historically at that time, but they'd be pigeonholed into a very specific circumstance and the same sort of people in this thread would bitch about their inclusion anyway--""Sure, they existed, but they weren't that important! Focusing on this character just so they could insert an Indian actor is pandering to the diversity crowd!"" Black actors have it a little better, because at least they can play a slave--or a servant, or one of this tiny handful of free-but-still-looked-down-upon roles--but they're still never ""*allowed*"" to play someone of import or influence. 

This is an issue that arose in the world of stageplays long ago. A lot of these plays, including very popular ones (like Shakespeare's) had fuck-all roles for people of non-white ethnicities, or even women. Yet the people putting on these shows decided, hey, this is kinda fucked, we've got a lot of actresses here and they're forever bound to playing demure and useless waifs with no lines, and Gary's black and all he's ever ""allowed"" to do is play a Moor, so **WHAT IF WE USED ~THE POWER OF IMAGINATION~** and let folks play whatever fucking role and trusted the audience to suspend another fraction of their disbelief, as they are already doing with so many other things in the story, to accept that Black Gary, *while he's playing actual-Hamlet*, is... Hamlet, and not Black Hamlet, The Mysteriously Dark-Skinned Son Of A White Guy. Or that when Martha is playing King Lear, she is in fact *King Lear*, A Guy With A Dick, not Queen Lear In Drag.

This whole problem arose and was addressed before anyone in this thread started making thinly-veiled bitchfests about the number of women or minorities in their fantasy shows or were even *born* for that matter.","i think you are missing the point that in my period drama there are black people they are slaves and come from africa

First off .. why did they decide to give Cade Bane such an overbite. Like it just makes his whole character look off in a bad way. 

Second.. the fight scenes have flashes of brilliance, but ultimately end up looking stupid for no reason other than no effort was put out to choreograph the whole fight scene. Examples Mando and Boba jetting out and flying around gunning people down are stellar. And it's proceeded by quite possibly the most boring gunfight I've ever seen. They literally land stand on the street with no cover no strategy and just get shot at. There is no suspense, nothing to look forward to since we know they are both going to lose. The rancor scene was another beautiful moment then ruined by Mando and his uncoordinated stage fake-looking fight sequence.

Third and final point. I feel like they should shift to a more CGI/editing heavy style. Because a lot of what we see now just looks overly fake and unrealistic. The movies made back in the 80s had better effects for crying out loud lol.

So you admit he didn’t explicitly contradict himself regarding women’s bears but you’re assuming he did because otherwise there’s no to support for your other assumption?

You’re literally making one assumption on top of another then declaring it canon, all based on your understanding of word choice, but you call it implication.

To imply something it needs to be virtually involved, a subject included by inference or deduction. The logical extension of “men have beards” and “women are indistinguishable from men” is “women have beards.” Leaving someone the room to make the deduction rather than stating everything explicitly is common, and a bit of a game to some.

I anticipate some resistance to word choice sometimes being a game of tricking those who assume too much, so take a look at the assumptions from words in the first sentence “contradicting” the second sentence here:

Also, you didn't even answered my question even though you should probably have guessed that they Shakespeare/Macbeth fans wouldn't be as upset unless they are also LOTR/Tolkien fans.

The reason as to why people don't like the idea of the black eleves is because it goes against Tolkien's literature, lore, and world. Tolkien wrote his books and characters based on Norse and Celtic mythology. Tolkien designed his races and characters in that way. He has never stated in his books that there are black elves exist in his world. 

Let's ask the next question then, why did the creators of this Amazon series include them? Did they not have enough money to hire a talented actor who is white?

Tom Shippy wasn’t fired. His contract as a consultant ended during the writing phase. That’s what happens when you’re a writing consultant. You don’t stay on during the whole project. 

It’s not arrogant to write “The Story that Tolkien never wrote”, because Tolkien died before he could write it. This is not the Lord of the Rings story, this is the Akallabeth. He wrote a broad outline and then died. 

Fuck you for shitting on unknown writers. THAT is sheer arrogance. What a Sarumannish thing to say. Peter Jackson was practically unknown. Half of his cast were practically unknown. His writers were practically unknown. 

Every single great writer ever was unknown until they published their writing. 


Original characters ARE *absolutely* necessary to this story because, see previous points, Tolkien only wrote a broad outline of this story before he died. We know that Sauron deceived the Lords of men. Well, we need to invent lords of men for him to deceive. They need families, motives, backstory, weaknesses. 

We know that elves, men, and dwarves allied to march on the black gate. We need dwarvish generals, mannish leaders other than Elendil and co. The elvish armies consisted of more than just Cirdan, Elrond, and Gilgalad. Each of those characters will need households, motives, weaknesses, strengths. 

One of the great dramas was the corruption of Ar-Pharazon. He is a mighty king. He needs advisors, a court, political supporters, and ministers. Each of those need to be lords or ladies with servants, families, allies, enemies, strengths and weaknesses.

The Faithful were his greatest political rivals after his turn to worshipping the Dark Lord (which, by the way, is going to need priests who have to be named characters). These Faithful are the political allies of Elindil, Anarion, and Isildur. They are going to need names, resources, and at least seven ships full of soldiers, families, and servants.

You can’t do ANY of this in like they did in the books because in a book you can simply say “The Faithful were the friends and allies of Elendil in his conflict with the King”, but in the show you have to ACTUALLY SHOW them being allies in the conflict, which means you actually have to write the details of the conflict and HOW they were allies and WHY it cost them so much. 

That same process applies to the whole story. 

Next up, warrior Galadriel. Tell me you don’t read Tolkien without telling me. Galadriel was a warrior queen who sought to command and conquer. She fought in more named battles than Glorfindel did, and EVERYONE agrees that Glorfindel was a mighty elven warrior. Galadriel was an Amazon who was stronger, faster, and more athletic than most male elves, and she would perform mighty feats of athletics to show that.","obscenely bad take dead wrong on every point

""Because of what they have seemingly changed""... what do you believe they have changed, and based on what extremely limited stuff they've shown? That there are original characters? That the timeline is compressed? What of the *decades* spent between Bilbo leaving the Shire and Frodo leaving on the Quest? What of absorption of other book characters into the characters as presented on film in the trilogy? Arwen is book Arwen and book Glorfindel combined.

""It feels like they think they can do better"". That is as subjective of an opinion as possible and, really, one of the biggest stretches that is likely furthest from the truth.

The region shown is *not* the Europe of Middle Earth. It is Numenor, the Atlantis of Middle Earth whose people *traveled far and wide and established trade and colonies as far as Umbar, Harad, and Beyond.* Eriador is, *possibly*, proto-Europe but that is not explicitly told nor does it make distinct geographical sense. Beleriand as it existed in the first age would have stretched all the way across the ocean to Canada and the Arctic, and of course at that time the world was flat and the sun passed over it and so anything you might like to surmise about real world skin tone implications compared to latitude don't really hold merit. Trees in Beleriand, if the sun worked the same way on flat Arda as on spherical Earth, would be no more than stumps. And that's just for considering *human* skin tone.

Elves, Dwarves, et all are *long gone* and are not the genetic ancestors of modern humans so likewise the skin tones of Elves and Dwarves are *irrelevant*. If modern European *humans* are ""white"" then it stands to reason that proto European *humans* should *probably* be white-ish but what has that got to do with extinct Elves and Dwarves?

Also black Dwarven skin in *any clan* makes sense. *Dwarves are made from Earth and Stone. Not all earth and stone is white. Dwarven skin color is not described by Tolkien*.

There isn't any good reason to think that diversity shouldn't exist in this setting except that it contradicts preconceived notions you might have that you are having trouble discarding.","pjs trilogy is lotr adapted to the screen and it is perfect not because it is merely lotr content but because of the love blood sweat tears etc

I spun out on a back road during a snowstorm, and the truck going the other way saw. I was only freshly 17, and terrified. Not hurt, just shaken super bad. They immediately turned around and helped me out of my car, brought me to their friends place i (luckily lol) crashed in front of, and they let me call police for help. I was given got cocoa and a snack while we waited for the police, and they helped me find someone to drag my car out of the ditch. They were literally my guardian angels. I didn't have a cell phone, and was 8 miles out of town, on a low traffic back road, aka screwed. 

Another time (again in winter, go figure) my mom and I were driving downstate through the adirondacks to see family for Thanksgiving. We were going slow, went to take a slow, slight bend in the road, and the car just kept going straight, and we ended up in the bank. A few minutes later a family in a van saw us and stopped. A young couple and their two young kids. The second they saw us they offered a ride to the nearest gas station with a phone. They really saved us, it was super dark out. But they still saw us in need, and trusted my mother and I enough to let us in their car and help. 

A third time, I was in college, living by myself in an efficiency near my school. I didn't have a job, I was living off what the military was paying me a month after my dad passed (rent was 375, and they have me 400$/mo, so beyond my one meal plan meal at college, I was broke).

I've bolded some key points...

We can clearly see Bard talking to Thorin in a bit of a harsh manner - a guilt-trip... they are trying to force his hand. His first words compare Thorin to a thief. Not a good start. He goes on to say ""we are not YET foes"" - clearly acknowledging they *could* be foes, if things don't go smoothly.

Clearly Thorin is paranoid of the not so friendly army (namely the Elves), and the thievery they could accomplish with such might. Thorin wants them gone (and those who may stay, weaponless) before they discuss matters of treasure. When his (fair) demands are not met, Thorin's pride ends negotiations.

Bard is asking for the Dale-portion of the treasure. Fair enough. Thorin notes it will be repaid, once the host departs. So Thorin isn't so taken by greed that he would steal. But Bard also asks for *more* than the Dale-portion... recompense for the Lakemen. This is where Thorin says 'no'. He notes the treasure is for the Dwarves alone - as it was theirs before Smaug robbed them of it. Bard appeals to pity for those that lost their lives and homes, but Thorin notes the Dwarves were in the same boat, once upon a time. Recompense for the Lakemen should not come from the Dwarf-inheritance - Smaug was the one at fault, not the Dwarves. And it's a fair point to make. Is it greedy? Sure. Is it unjust? No. Thorin makes good points.

Thorin could have just given the treasure out, and conflict could have been avoided. He was greedy, yes. That being said, he was also right... they were trying to get *more* than is their right, and being threatening - Thorin had be very careful, lest Erebor be robbed.

Consider this: if a homeless man asked you for money, you'd probably be willing to help. But what if said man had a hand on a holstered gun, as he's asking? (I mean, you'd give it to him out of fear, but I digress...) Not out of the kindness of your heart. He's threatening to rob you - so fuck him. This is the boat Thorin is in. (At the same time, you understand why the Lakemen are desperate, and would want to force Thorin's hand)","both can be true

now these were fair words and true if proudly and grimly spoken and bilbo thought that thorin would at once admit what justice was in them he did not of course expect that any one would remember that it was he who discovered all by himself the dragons weak spot and that was just as well for no one ever did but also he did not reckon with the power that gold has upon which a dragon has long brooded nor with dwarvish hearts long hours in the past days thorin had spent in the treasury and the lust of it was heavy on him though he had hunted chiefly for the arkenstone yet he had an eye for many another wonderful thing that was lying there about which were wound old memories of the labours and the sorrows of his race  
  
you put your worst cause last and in the chief place thorin answered to the treasure of my people no man has a claim because smaug who stole it from us also robbed him of life or home the treasure was not his that his evil deeds should be amended with a share of it the price of the goods and the assistance that we received of the lakemen we will fairly payin due time but nothing will we give not even a loafs worth under threat of force while an armed host lies before our doors we look on you as foes and thieves  
  
it is in my mind to ask what share of their inheritance you would have paid to our kindred had you found the hoard unguarded and us slain  
  
a just question replied bard but you are not dead and we are not robbers moreover the wealthy may have pity beyond right on the needy that befriended them when they were in want and still my other claims remain unanswered  
  
i will not parley as i have said with armed men at my gate nor at all with the people of the elvenking whom i remember with small kindness in this debate they have no place begone now ere our arrows fly and if you would speak with me again first dismiss the elvish host to the woods where it belongs and then return laying down your arms before you approach the threshold  
  
the elvenking is my friend and he has succoured the people of the lake in their need though they had no claim but friendship on him answered bard we will give you time to repent your words gather your wisdom ere we return then he departed and went back to the c  
  
ere many hours were past the bannerbearers returned and trumpeters stood forth and blew a blast  
  
in the name of esgaroth and the forest one cried we speak unto thorin thrains son oakenshield calling himself the king under the mountain and we bid him consider well the claims that have been urged or be declared our foe at the least he shall deliver one twelfth portion of the treasure unto bard as the dragonslayer and as the heir of girion from that portion bard will himself contribute to the aid of esgaroth but if thorin would have the friendship and honour of the lands about as his sires had of old then he will give also somewhat of his own for the comfort of the men of the lake  
  
then thorin seized a bow of horn and shot an arrow at the speaker it smote into his shield and stuck there quivering

ive bolded some key points

we can clearly see bard talking to thorin in a bit of a harsh manner  a guilttrip they are trying to force his hand his first words compare thorin to a thief not a good start he goes on to say we are not yet foes  clearly acknowledging they could be foes if things dont go smoothly

clearly thorin is paranoid of the not so friendly army namely the elves and the thievery they could accomplish with such might thorin wants them gone and those who may stay weaponless before they discuss matters of treasure when his fair demands are not met thorins pride ends negotiations

bard is asking for the daleportion of the treasure fair enough thorin notes it will be repaid once the host departs so thorin isnt so taken by greed that he would steal but bard also asks for more than the daleportion recompense for the lakemen this is where thorin says no he notes the treasure is for the dwarves alone  as it was theirs before smaug robbed them of it bard appeals to pity for those that lost their lives and homes but thorin notes the dwarves were in the same boat once upon a time recompense for the lakemen should not come from the dwarfinheritance  smaug was the one at fault not the dwarves and its a fair point to make is it greedy sure is it unjust no thorin makes good points

thorin could have just given the treasure out and conflict could have been avoided he was greedy yes that being said he was also right they were trying to get more than is their right and being threatening  thorin had be very careful lest erebor be robbed

consider this if a homeless man asked you for money youd probably be willing to help but what if said man had a hand on a holstered gun as hes asking i mean youd give it to him out of fear but i digress not out of the kindness of your heart hes threatening to rob you  so fuck him this is the boat thorin is in at the same time you understand why the lakemen are desperate and would want to force thorins hand"

The guy doesn’t need an intro. He’s a gunslinger for hire. He’s obviously old. He does any job as long as the price is good enough.
I don’t know the backstory. I don’t need it. The hat. The guns. The coat. Its obvious who and what he is. And he almost killed our favorite marshal. That’s all we need to know.

He’s the bad guy.

And if you do know the backstory then good for you.

Boba fett gets a lot of internet rage. Most of it is just for shit n giggles I guess because overall the show is more then good enough. Netflix is filled with way worse shite.","ive seen cod cad cud bane exactly once before  bad batch
